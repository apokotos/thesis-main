This study suggests the combination of the scientific Scopus articles with the more dynamic Google online news, in order to examine and trace the risks related to the supply chain. 
There are two notebooks, one for the analysis of the Scopus articles (scopus_articles.ipynb) and one for the analysis of the Google News (Web Scraping.ipynb). The rest of the files are needed or produced while running the code. For the data retrieval, it is recommended to run the code only once and store the results in the respective csv files.
