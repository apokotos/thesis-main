    "The world is a difficult place to be as a supply chain expert today and will only get more difficult in the future. We're living in a time of near unprecedented uncertainty in the modern era and the risk it brings to supply chain management is immense. To manage the potential chaos, you must be proactive and prepared to shift your strategies on a dime. From natural disasters and wars, to trade disputes and unreliable suppliers, you must be ready for everything.\n\nHow to create a strong risk management strategy.\n\nTrain your team in risk awareness and build organizational habits around it\n\nRisk management is built from the ground up. When you're trying to make plans around what could go wrong in your organization, you need to build a framework that allows individual employees to not only spot potential risks, but to report them with no fear or reprisal. Regular training programs on risks for your company and fast-response drills are integral to being ready when something goes wrong. These processes should be well known at all levels of your organization and practiced regularly. Another important lesson to learn, as underlined by McKinsey, is that employees should not worry about coming to their managers or executives with problems or mistakes they've made. A culture of blame, shooting the messenger and heavy punishment means that potential risks or mistakes in a company will remain hidden out of fear.\n\nOne acronym could save you a lot of headaches\n\nWhile a common acronym in the supply chain world, it's always best to keep prevention, preparedness, response, and recovery (PPRR) front of mind when you think about developing your risk management strategy. In order to make your plan fully effective, you should be doing the following for each step.\n\nPrevention\n\nAn ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. Building the aforementioned organizational habits of risk management is just the start. Your organization should also be building a comprehensive risk management plan in order to properly identify and mitigate risks before they happen. You should also be conducting regular reviews of both your internal processes as well as of the readiness of your suppliers to deal with risk and unforeseen events.\n\nPreparedness\n\nThis is the simplest step, the best way to prepare is to develop a list of your known risks and create strategies and tools to react quickly.\n\nResponse\n\nYou must be ready to respond immediately in the face of a supply chain crisis or employee mistake as the effects of inaction can compound the problem. Having a rapid response team trained in common situations and defined before a problem can arise will help mitigate the effects of the issue.\n\nRecovery\n\nIn order to ensure your business can continue as normal, your organization should develop strategies in order to recover in case of a supply chain emergency. From having backup sources for crucial materials to having a public relations plan in place in case of shortages, having a clear idea of what to do in the most dire circumstances is critical to bouncing back after a setback.",
    "If you\u2019re selling to the federal government, you need to take a closer look at your supply chain risk management process.\n\nThe software supply chain is, as most of us know by now, both a blessing and a curse. It\u2019s an amazing, labyrinthine, complex (some would call it messy) network of components that, when it works as designed and intended, delivers the magical conveniences and advantages of modern life: Information and connections from around the world plus unlimited music, videos, and other entertainment, all in our pockets. Vehicles with lane assist and accident avoidance. Home security systems. Smart traffic systems. And on and on.\n\nBut when one or more of those components has defects that can be exploited by criminals, it can be risky and dangerous. It puts the entire chain in jeopardy. You know\u2014the weakest link syndrome. Software vulnerabilities can be exploited to disrupt the distribution of fuel or food. It can be leveraged to steal identities, empty bank accounts, loot intellectual property, spy on a nation, and even attack a nation.\n\nSo the security of every link in the software supply chain is important\u2014important enough to have made it into a portion of President Joe Biden\u2019s May 12, 2021 executive order, \u201cImproving the Nation\u2019s Cybersecurity\u201d (also known as EO 14028).\n\nIt\u2019s also important enough to have been one of the primary topics of discussion at the 2022 RSA Conference in San Francisco. Among dozens of presentations on the topic at the conference was \u201cSoftware supply chain: The challenges, risks, and strategies for success\u201d by Tim Mackey, principal security strategist within the Synopsys Cybersecurity Research Center (CyRC).\n\nSoftware supply chain challenges\n\nThe challenges and risks are abundant. For starters, too many organizations don\u2019t always vet the software components they buy or pull from the internet. Mackey noted that while some companies do a thorough background check on vendors before they buy\u2014covering everything from the executive team, financials, ethics, product quality, and other factors to generate a vendor risk-assessment score\u2014that isn\u2019t the norm.\n\n\u201cThe rest of the world is coming through, effectively, an unmanaged procurement process,\u201d he said. \u201cIn fact, developers love that they can just download anything from the internet and bring it into their code.\u201d\n\nWhile there may be some regulatory or compliance requirements on those developers, \u201cthey typically aren\u2019t there from the security perspective,\u201d Mackey said. \u201cSo once you\u2019ve decided that, say, an Apache license is an appropriate thing to use within an organization, whether there are any unpatched CVEs [Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures] associated with anything with an Apache license, that\u2019s somebody else\u2019s problem. There\u2019s a lot of things that fall into the category of somebody else\u2019s problem.\u201d\n\nThen there\u2019s the fact that the large majority of the software in use today\u2014nearly 80%\u2014 is open source, as documented by the annual \u201cOpen Source Security and Risk Analysis\u201d (OSSRA) report by the Synopsys Cybersecurity Research Center.\n\nOpen source software is no more or less secure than commercial or proprietary software and is hugely popular for good reasons\u2014it\u2019s usually free and can be customized to do whatever a user wants, within certain licensing restrictions.\n\nBut, as Mackey noted, open source software is generally made by volunteer communities\u2014sometimes very small communities\u2014and those involved may eventually lose interest or be unable to maintain a project. That means if vulnerabilities get discovered, they won\u2019t necessarily get fixed.\n\nAnd even when patches are created to fix vulnerabilities, they don\u2019t get \u201cpushed\u201d to users. Users must \u201cpull\u201d them from a repository. So if they don\u2019t know they\u2019re using a vulnerable component in their software supply chain, they won\u2019t know they need to pull in a patch, leaving them exposed. The infamous Log4Shell group of vulnerabilities in the open source Apache logging library Log4j is one of the most recent examples of that.\n\n6 considerations for securing your software supply chain\n\nManage your supply chain risks\n\nTo manage that risk requires some serious effort. Simply keeping track of the components in a software product can get very complicated very quickly. Mackey told of a simple app he created that had eight declared \u201cdependencies\u201d\u2014components necessary to make the app do what the developer wants it to do. But one of those eight had 15 dependencies of its own. And one of those 15 had another 30. By the time he got several levels deep, there were 133\u2014for just one relatively simple app.\n\nAlso, within those 133 dependencies were \u201cmultiple instances of code that had explicit end-of-life statements associated with them,\u201d he said. That means it was no longer going to be maintained or updated.\n\nAnd simply keeping track of components is not enough. There are other questions organizations should be asking themselves, according to Mackey. They include, Do you\n\nhave secure development environments? Are you able to bring your supply chain back to integrity? Do you regularly test for vulnerabilities and remediate them?\n\n\u201cThis is very detailed stuff,\u201d he said, adding still more questions. Do you understand your code provenance and what the controls are? Are you providing a software Bill of Materials (SBOM) for every single product you\u2019re creating? \u201cI can all but guarantee that the majority of people on this [conference] show floor are not doing that today,\u201d he said.\n\nSecurity is a coordinated effort\n\nBut if organizations want to sell software products to the U.S. government, these are things they need to start doing. \u201cThe contract clauses for the U.S. government are in the process of being rewritten,\u201d he said. \u201cThat means any of you who are producing software that is going to be consumed by the government need to pay attention to this. And it\u2019s a moving target\u2014you may not be able to sell to the U.S. government the way that you\u2019re used to doing it.\u201d\n\nEven SBOMs, while useful and necessary\u2014and a hot topic in software supply chain security\u2014are not enough, Mackey said.\n\n\u201cSupply chain risk management (SCRM) is really about a set of coordinated efforts within an organization to identify, monitor, detect what\u2019s going on. And it includes the software you create as well as acquire, because even though it might be free, it still needs to go through the same process,\u201d he said.\n\nAmong those coordinated efforts is the need to deal with code components such as libraries, within the supply chain that are deprecated\u2014no longer being maintained. Mackey said developers who aren\u2019t aware of that will frequently send \u201cpull requests\u201d asking when the next update on a library is coming.\n\nAnd if there is a reply at all, it\u2019s that that the component is end-of-life been end-of-life and that the only thing to do is move to another library.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut what if everything depends on it?\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a perfect example of the types of problems we\u2019re going to run into as we start managing software supply chains.\u201d\n\nAnother problem is that developers don\u2019t even know about some dependencies they\u2019re pulling into a software project, and whether those might have vulnerabilities.\n\n\u201cThe OSSRA report found that the top framework with vulnerabilities last year was jQuery [a JavaScript library]. Nobody decides to use JQuery, it comes along for the ride,\u201d he said, adding that that is true of others as well, including Lodash (a JavaScript library) and Spring Framework (an application framework and inversion of control container for the Java platform). \u201cThey all come along for the ride,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re not part of any monitoring. They\u2019re not getting patched because people simply don\u2019t know about them.\u201d\n\nNIST guidance on software supply chain security\n\nThere are multiple other necessary activities in SCRM that, collectively, are intended to make it much more likely that a software product can be trusted. Many of them are contained in the guidance on software supply chain security issued in early May by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in response to the Biden EO.\n\nMackey said this means that organizations will need their \u201cprocurement teams to be working with the government\u2019s team to define what the security requirements are. Those requirements are then going to inform what the IT team is going to do\u2014what a secure deployment means. So when somebody buys something you have that information going into procurement for validation.\u201d\n\n\u201cA provider needs to be able to explain what their SBOM is and where they got their code because that\u2019s where the patches need to come from,\u201d he said.\n\nFinally, Mackey said the biggest threat is the tendency to assume that if something is secure at one point in time, it will always be secure.\n\n\u201cWe love to put check boxes beside things\u2014move them to the done column and leave them there,\u201d he said. \u201cThe biggest threat we have is that someone\u2019s going to exploit the fact that we have a check mark on something that is in fact a dynamic something\u2014not a static something that deserves a check mark. That\u2019s the real world. It\u2019s messy\u2014really messy.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t wait; get started today\n\nHow prepared are software vendors to implement the security measures that will eventually be required of them? Mackey said he has seen reports showing that for some of those measures, the percentage is as high as 44%. \u201cBut around 18% is more typical,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople are getting a little bit of the message, but we\u2019re not quite there yet.\u201d\n\nSo for those who want to sell to the government, it\u2019s time to get moving. \u201cThe clock is ticking,\u201d Mackey said.\n\nLearn how to manage your supply chain risks\n\nLearn more",
    "The war in Europe, inflationary pressures, and the ongoing fallout from a global pandemic are all contributing to supply chain disruption across many industries. Insureds need a risk management partner who can meet their needs as a consultant, in addition to providing tailor-made coverage.\n\nSupply chain risk is not a new concept to underwriters or risk managers. But it\u2019s no exaggeration to say that the degree to which supply chain problems are now impairing the operations of businesses across many sectors is unprecedented in our lifetimes.\n\n\u201cI read the other day that something like 95% of Fortune 1,000 companies have reported significant disruption from supply chain right now. That\u2019s about as systemic as you can get,\u201d said Seth Hedrington, Senior Vice President, Major Accounts \u2013 Risk Management at Liberty Mutual.\n\nSupply chain issues affect not only the ability of businesses to receive vital materials, they also impede their ability to fulfill their contracts and deliver goods to their end customers.\n\n\u201cThe broader risk management concerns involve supply chain uncertainty, quality control, and contract liability. Talent risk is also a factor, given to what degree labor shortages are impacting manufacturing, construction, hospitality, retail and a host of other industries,\u201d said Heath Kidd, Vice President, Industry Solutions for Liberty Mutual. \u201cIt\u2019s really hard to overstate just how pervasive these issues are across industries and the risk landscape.\u201d\n\nDifferent causes, similar solutions\n\nThe reasons why we\u2019re seeing supply chain disruptions to this degree are many and varied and they overlap in some cases. But chief among them are an ongoing global pandemic, war in Ukraine, and the aforementioned labor shortages and inflationary pressures that are driving up the costs of materials for numerous industries.\n\nRegardless of the causes of supply chain disruptions, yesterday, today, or in the future, the approach to managing these risks holds true over time and across sectors.\n\n\u201cI think a lot of companies have been taken off guard with the severity of the supply chain issues they are facing and don\u2019t want to get burned again. Managing supply chain risk can and should be a proactive risk management decision. And it goes beyond insurance coverage. There are a lot of operational considerations that can help mitigate the risk significantly, and we\u2019re seeing many of our customers taking those steps,\u201d said Hedrington.\n\nThere will be those that take little action, and that is a legitimate choice, but they should understand that they\u2019re essentially self-insuring against that risk. It comes down to a business decision.\u201d he added.\n\nFour key mitigation measures to manage supply chain disruption\n\n1) Vet your extended supply chain. \u201cFirst and foremost, companies should be thinking about supply chain vetting,\u201d Hedrington explained. \u201cAnd in many cases, that can be a pretty long chain; longer or more complex than you might expect.\u201d He outlined that most companies have traditionally studied their key suppliers to gauge whether they can deliver vital goods and services when and where they say they can.\n\nBut he said it\u2019s not as common for companies to vet their secondary and tertiary suppliers.\n\n\u201cI think one of the key mitigation techniques is expanding your view of what the supply chain really is beyond those primary suppliers,\u201d Hedrington said.\n\nThat includes vetting suppliers, especially when onboarding new vendors to meet material shortfalls from existing vendors or seeking to diversify suppliers. Businesses might also want to consider ensuring that supply chain partners include the business as an additional insured on general liability policies, Kidd said.\n\nCommunication with the insurers and brokers of suppliers at every tier should be open and as frequent as possible to make sure that all stakeholders are responding to this increased supply chain risk and managing their operations accordingly, he added.\n\n2) Reassess your business continuity plan. A second key factor, Hedrington said, is maintaining an up-to-date and quality control-focused business continuity plan.\n\n\u201cDoes your business continuity plan include where you will source key materials if a primary supplier dries up?\u201d is a question Hedrington posed.\n\nHe also explained that many companies may be considering material substitutions to adapt to shortages, but that this can carry unaccounted for risks.\n\nMany of us remember the notable substitution of Chinese drywall after the American made drywall supply ran out due to the rebuilding demand after several severe hurricanes hit the Southeast. The Chinese drywall that was used to build thousands of homes there between 2002 and 2007 was found to be defective, causing health issues and property damage.\n\n\u201cMake sure you proactively have and maintain relationships so you can go to a secondary, even a third source as needed,\u201d Hedrington said.\n\nKidd noted that product liability and product defect claims can have serious consequences and long tails.\n\nBeyond taking all the preventive measures to ensure the quality of materials, that also means developing plans to respond to situations where a substituted material isn\u2019t up to snuff and anticipating how to manage the fallout.\n\nAnalyzing to what degree labor shortages could impact quality is also something to keep in mind given the challenges many businesses are facing in finding skilled workers and keeping their operations fully staffed.\n\n3) Re-evaluate inventory management. A third mitigation technique, and one that represents a significant change in how companies operate their businesses, is inventory management.\n\nThere was a time in the not-too-distant past that just-in-time delivery was all the rage in manufacturing, retail, and other sectors. The logic was that companies could save money by ordering and receiving the products they needed within a predictable target date, forestalling the need to tie up capital in extensive inventory levels. But it has left a lot of businesses empty handed amidst the recent challenges to the supply chain.\n\n\u201cHealthcare and the crisis of PPE, even ventilators, in the early days of the pandemic are examples of this vulnerability,\u201d said Kidd. \u201cMany, probably most, hospitals didn\u2019t have enough protective equipment available during the first surges of the virus. Because of the lead times and supply chain issues, you just couldn\u2019t get them. A lot of them are rethinking that.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow the same thing is happening across all sorts of industries, and that applies to raw materials, as well as parts and equipment. Many businesses are trying to offset this risk by keeping more items on hand. But this introduces some other risks that insureds may not be thinking about.\u201d\n\nFor example, as inventory levels rise many businesses are faced with warehousing constraints. It\u2019s important to consider other related issues, like scaling property coverages to match what\u2019s on-hand, as well as maintaining up-to-date appraisals to ensure coverage is adequate.\n\n4) Proactively manage contracts. A fourth technique is contract vigilance and flexibility. Widespread supply chain disruption means that many companies are at risk of not being able to deliver goods and services at the price level and delivery date they promised.\n\n\u201cA lot of companies right now are scrambling because they\u2019re potentially facing breach of contract issues,\u201d Hedrington said.\n\nTheir contracts weren\u2019t flexible enough so that if they came up against adverse conditions, they\u2019d have some wiggle room.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re having them proactively look at that as another non-insurance technique as well,\u201d Hedrington said.\n\nThis should include a sober assessment of a company\u2019s ability to complete projects on time, within contract specifications, and on budget. Breach of contract or financial performance issues can result in professional liability claims. It\u2019s important to continually assess the adequacy of coverage and adapt to reflect the changing environment, even with the knowledge that these types of claims tend to have long tails, so the true impact may not be seen for some time to come.\n\nA productive partnership\n\nWhether it be a need for supply chain vetting, strengthening a business continuity plan, identifying alternate suppliers, or analyzing the suitability of customer contracts, Liberty Mutual is working with customers and brokers to help see them through this period of disruption, they said.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s at times like this that you come to really appreciate those collaborative partnerships. Maybe the whole lesson of all this is just how interconnected business is today. No one is going to be able to get through this alone. That applies to insurance and is why it\u2019s so important to have a team that can bring the best insights to those planning conversations and offer the risk control guidance that can help minimize some of these impacts in the future,\u201d said Kidd.\n\n\u201cWhere we differentiate ourselves, beyond the products and services we offer, is that we meet clients where they are from a risk perspective and truly help them fill in the gaps,\u201d Hedrington said. \u201cWe are partners in all areas of risk management, not just the product [insurance coverage] side of things,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cWe incorporate feedback based on what we\u2019re seeing, what the claims data is telling us, and what our customers are experiencing in the market and then respond to that with industry insights, trends \u2014 observations that then allow us to inform a better process going forward,\u201d Kidd said.\n\n\u201cI think that\u2019s what sets Liberty apart. And I think that allows us to be in tune with what our customers need and be responsive to the demands in the marketplace.\u201d\n\nTo learn more, please visit https://www.business.libertymutual.com/.\n\nThis article was produced by the R&I Brand Studio, a unit of the advertising department of Risk & Insurance, in collaboration with Liberty Mutual Insurance.

Andrew Park 94th Airlift Wing - An 870th Air Expeditionary Squadron aerial porter pushes a pallet into the cargo area of a C-17 Globemaster III at Al Asad Air Base, Iraq, Jan. 9, 2017.\n\nThe Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency is developing a guide to help agencies overcome the challenges of managing cyber supply chain risks.\n\nAccording to Brian Paap, Cyber Engineering Consultant at CISA, the agency has been working on how to approach Cyber Supply Chain Risk Management (CSCRIM) over the past two years.\n\nCISA recently ran a pilot designed to figure out all of the measures required to stand up and sustain a CSCRIM program within federal departments and agencies.\n\nPaap noted CISA has recently developed the Overview and Guidelines document, which combines learnings from NIST 161 and elements of NIST 853, Rev 5 and several other resources.\n\n\u201cWhat we tried to do is turn all of this 'what' that NIST, DOD and industry provided into 'how' you do that. Essentially turning the what into the how for standing up and sustaining a CSCRIM program,\u201d Paap said during ATARC\u2019s Overview of Standards and Mandates, Tools and Solutions to Manage Cyber Supply Chain Risks Event.\n\nIn 2013, the White House released an executive order for specific agencies to stand up a CSRIM capability, which was followed by the passage of the 2018 Security Act that requested CFO ACT agencies implement their own CSCRIM program.\n\n\u201cIn 2020 we held listening sessions with the CFO ACT agencies and they said, can you tell us how to do this and give us boiler plate language to better protect ourselves and so we listened to them and that\u2019s what really drove us into the pilot and where we are today,\u201d Paap said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot more that can be done for the fed govt. And the number one issue across the board is funding and resources.\u201d\n\nPaap also talked about the importance of developing guidelines for overcoming any obstacles to CSCRIM implementation.\n\n\u201cThe problems with NIST doctrine is they\u2019re asking you to do things but there is no method of how to do all of those things. Rather than 101 agencies doing it 101 different ways. We want to set the parameters around it and guide them through process of doing this the right way,\u201d Paap said.\n\nDuring the event Nnake Nweke, Director of Cybersecurity Supply Chain Risk Management, Office of Information Technology Category at the U.S. General Services Administration, talked about the challenges with implementing and managing supply chain risk management.\n\nSome common obstacles are resources, workforce training and supply chain risk control requirements that are set out for vendors.\n\n\u201cDefining requirements is one of the biggest challenges. Trying to strike the right balance between what is really required and what is sufficient. Also, making sure requirements are not impacting their ability to operate. Striking the right balance without sacrificing security is critical,\u201d Nweke said.\n\nPaap said one of the most challenging steps involves securing software provided and managed by second- and third-party vendors.\n\n\u201cI like to look at is as rules before tools. You need to have the methods down before you can perform the actions because you don\u2019t know if the actions you\u2019re performing are correct unless you know what it\u2019s supposed to be based on your mission,\u201d Paap said.",

Perform a business criticality and impact analysis for each third-party application.As you complete the matrix, consider questions like:During this phase, organizations should also evaluate whether the new application will expand the organization\u2019s attack surface. This can give attackers opportunities to pivot internally to other critical assets, using API calls for example.After organizations plot each third-party application on a criticality and impact matrix, they should consider the amount of risk they can tolerate in each matrix band. For instance: What would make you feel confident in your supplier\u2019s ability to resist attacks against your riskiest data or most critical apps?Quantify the impact of a potential disruption, and the likelihood of disruption if a control point should fail, to help define the security requirements you expect to see implemented in the software that you are considering. For example, the sensitivity of the data involved might evoke requirements for data encryption and key management.When a software supplier confirms that it can satisfy your baseline security requirements, that may feel like a win for the compliance team \u2014 however, the software might still use vulnerable open-source libraries, and it might not address critical security risks. How can an eager software supplier provide you with an acceptable level of comfort?For some organizations, that acceptable level of comfort would require a full-scale adversarial test using the most sophisticated intrusion techniques. Other organizations might want a thorough understanding of the supplier\u2019s internal security controls, like asking the supplier to demonstrate adherence to leading secure software development lifecycle and DevSecOps practices, or show that controls have been validated by a reputable auditor. You might choose to perform security testing on your own.Most cybersecurity leaders are faced with the reality of having to balance security against resource availability and responsiveness to the business. So, it may not be practical to engage NSA-certified testers for each of the most critical applications. Here are some of the assurance activities that can provide appropriate confidence \u2014 and level of comfort \u2014 in the security posture of a third-party software solution:Moment-on-time reviews are insufficient in today\u2019s world of weekly, if not daily, code releases. So, how frequently should you conduct testing? Your approach can range from an annual self-attestation or recertification to monthly vulnerability find-and-fix reports from your software suppliers. You could even enroll in a continuous manual penetration testing program where your third-party applications are tested without prior notice to the software supplier.Your software supply chain risk analysis, security requirements, and approach to assurance requirements will help define your internal policy and decision-making process for software acquisition.This secure software acquisition policy should cover how your organization thinks about its data and business operations, capturing your criticality impact analysis and the levels of assurance appropriate for each criticality and impact band. It should also include the appropriate terms of acquisition, or the requirements imposed on the organization\u2019s software suppliers.This policy should be detailed enough to direct contract negotiations with software vendors, ensuring the right security requirements are included and that terms flow down to nth-party providers of code for critical and sensitive applications. \u201cThe secure software acquisition policy is an expression of consensus about the organization\u2019s risk tolerance,\u201d noted Grant Thornton Cybersecurity and Privacy Advisory Services Managing Director Maxim Kovalsky.The point where you negotiate terms with a vendor is not the time to internally ask, \u201cReally, how committed are we to our policy?\u201d That\u2019s why senior business leaders should be prepared to accept that a software supplier\u2019s inability to follow this policy may require walking away from an otherwise desirable business relationship.Your secure software acquisition policy needs to identify the stakeholders involved in the software acquisition process and their roles in this process. This helps to ensure the appropriate support for your policy, and clearly defines important roles and responsibilities across the organization, such as:It is important to ensure that each area understands its responsibilities for enforcing the policy. Outside of established Secure SDLC standards and company policies, management oversight for control points in the development and change processes can quickly break down when you introduce third parties and, in turn, their own suppliers. Control execution might pass down the supply chain to vendors, but your organization remains responsible to monitor control adherence.To assess and manage digital supply chain risks, organizations need:With all of this in place, organizations will require unity around the importance of software supply chain risk management.All of the individuals identified in your policy must understand their roles and the importance of enforcing the policy. Any exception to the policy is a fundamental flaw, as it brings into question the hard-earned consensus about the organization\u2019s risk tolerance. An exception can also introduce questions like: How frequent are exceptions allowed, and who is assuming these risks across the organization?While many organizations treat policy exceptions and risk acceptances as synonyms, we argue that risk acceptance naturally occurs as you determine your requirements and level of assurance appropriate for the business use cases of software being procured. That is, the organization may accept that a less critical application will be subject to less stringent security requirements, and that visibility into how those requirements are enforced may be limited. Exceptions then should be treated as a deferral of specific assessment activities and controls until a date in the very near future.Software supply chain risks are only growing in their importance, as shown by recent attacks and legislation like thethese attacks pose ato organizations. That\u2019s why it is essential to intentionally form and enforce an organizational policy that helps to manage software supply chain risks.Managing Director, Cybersecurity and Privacy Advisory Services+1 646 354 0463Senior Manager, Risk Advisory Services+1 973 626 5310",
    "ORLANDO\u2014From nature to military operations, the ability to offset weaknesses against predators is a key survival strategy. Today\u2019s supply chain leaders should take note.\n\nThat was the opening message Monday at Gartner Inc.\u2019s Supply Chain Symposium, where analyst Ken Chadwick called on attendees to prepare offset strategies for five \u201curgent challenges\u201d: cognitive overload, customer experience, accelerating technology, cyber risk and energy instability.\n\n\"It's time to stop coping\": Gartner's Ken Chadwick says supply chain leaders should be deploying \"offset strategies\" for cognitive overload, evolving customer expectations, changing tech, cyber risk and energy instability #GartnerSC pic.twitter.com/cHo1UIxu06 \u2014 SupplyChainBrain (@SCBrain) June 6, 2022\n\n\u201cOffset strategies are a proven way to shift the competitive landscape by applying unconventional or untried approaches to leverage individual strengths,\u201d said Chadwick, vice president analyst with Gartner\u2019s Supply Chain practice. \u201cIf the offset strategy focuses on the most critical matters of our time, supply chain leaders can reap immediate rewards.\u201d\n\nCognitive Overload\n\nThe pandemic, its resulting supply chain disruptions, and the shift to remote and hybrid work models increased the complexity of work and changed collaboration and decision-making which made many employees feel overwhelmed. Instead of adding more complexity to the situation, supply chain leaders should aim to simplify how work is done.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen great successes with constrained decision-making. This model deliberately reduces the number of people involved in a decision and the time people have to gather information and make the decision. CSCOs can also outsource some decision-making to artificial intelligence,\u201d Chadwick said.\n\nCustomer Expectations\n\nTo offset rapidly evolving customer needs, supply chain leaders must shift from a \u201cjust-in-time\u201d mindset that primarily focuses on internal cost and efficiency goals, to a \u201cjust-the-customer\u201d mindset, focusing externally on customer needs. This shift will provide supply chains the opportunity to reposition its commercial contribution to the business to one that delivers both optimization and drives business growth.\n\n\"We believe that 'just-in-time' is no longer a core plot line in our supply chain hero story,\" says @Gartner_inc VP Analyst Ken Chadwick at #GartnerSC Symposium pic.twitter.com/QYy2HkNOKM \u2014 SupplyChainBrain (@SCBrain) June 6, 2022\n\nEnergy Instability\n\nDisruptive events, such as the Texas ice storm in 2021, showed that relying on a singular supply of energy can cause failure. Humanities\u2019 need to consume energy is also having an impact on the environment. One way for CSCOs to address this challenge is to enable distributed, sustainable energy management, where the power demand of factories, fleets and other parts of the value chain is supplied by a distributed network consisting of renewables, micro grids and battery storage.\n\nTechnology Change\n\nAccording to Gartner research, the biggest challenge facing supply chain leaders in the technology space is not necessarily the technology itself. It is embracing and adapting to new technologies and envisioning new ways of doing business. That\u2019s why CSCOs must be at the forefront of change and inspire their employees to use and trust the next generation of technology.\n\nCyber Risk\n\nGartner research has found that over 80% of companies experienced a significant cybersecurity incident in the last two years. This development is driven by connected technology networks and cyber-physical systems, such as sensors and smart vehicles. Supply chain leaders can react to this evolving risk by partnering with the chief information security officer to build a cybersecurity framework.\n\n\u201cCSCOs cannot control if, or when, they get hit by a cyberattack. What they can control are their own decisions on investments and actions. Supply chain leaders must realize that cybersecurity is not just an IT issue. It includes making decisions on partners, conducting realistic risk assessments and integrating a cybersecurity perspective into everything they do,\u201d Chadwick said.\n\nFollow SupplyChainBrain at Gartner's Supply Chain Symposium/Xpo on LinkedIn and Twitter.",

    "Attacks on supply chains are growing in numbers and complexity. In the last two months since the initiation of the Russia-Ukraine war, inbound attacks from APT groups targeted at shipping, surface transport, retail warehouses, pharma APT supply entities, oil and gas, and coal mining sectors have risen significantly. Spillover attacks on several other enterprises which depend on these entities have also grown. The attacks are coming from known APT groups in South East Asia and Russia and seem to be oriented towards creating a large-scale disruption.\n\nAlso Read: Why IoT Security is important in today\u2019s network?\n\nIt is therefore no surprise that the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has updated its foundational cybersecurity supply chain risk management (C-SCRM) guidance to enable enterprises to improve their security measures as they go about acquiring and adding more technology products and services to their infrastructure.\n\nNIST has issued a revised publication called Cybersecurity Supply Chain Risk Management Practices for Systems and Organizations (NIST Special Publication 800-161 Revision 1). This publication, according to NIST, offers guidance and inputs on identifying, assessing, and responding to all types of cybersecurity risks spread across all supply chain levels of an organization.\n\nThe document acknowledges the challenges in securing supply chains arising from an information asymmetry that exists between acquiring enterprises and their suppliers and service providers. It goes on to say \u201cthat acquirers often lack visibility and understanding of how acquired technology is developed, integrated, and deployed and how the services that they acquire are delivered\u201d\n\nCompliance Kit: IoT and OT cybersecurity self-assessment tool using NIST CSF\n\nHere are the highlights of NIST\u2019s new revision:\n\nThe publication outlines key steps that organizations can adopt to manage supply chain risks\n\nOrganizations are encouraged to view vulnerabilities associated with the whole production process of a finished product and its components.

    "New York (CNN Business) More tieups at West Coast ports are just about the last thing the US economy needs right now.\n\nBut a current round of labor talks between management at the 29 ports up and down the coast and the International Longshore and Warehouse Union whose members load and unload the ships has businesses that depend on the ports very, very worried.\n\n\"I'm extremely nervous. I've seen this movie before,\" said Isaac Larian, CEO of toy maker MGA Entertainment, best known for its Bratz dolls. \"There's no real alternative to using these ports. I'm praying twice a day, rather than once.\"\n\nThe contract that covers about 16,000 members of the International Longshore and Warehouse Union working at the ports is due to expire July 1. At this point, it's unlikely a deal will be reached before that date.\n\nManagement and the union issued a statement last week trying to assure businesses that even though the two sides don't expect to reach a new deal before next month, they're ready and willing to keep working under terms of the existing contract.\n\n\"Neither party is preparing for a strike or a lockout, contrary to speculation in news reports,\" said the joint statement. \"The parties remain focused on and committed to reaching an agreement.\"\n\nBut experts say companies that depend on the ports have every reason to be worried.\n\n\"There's definitely nervousness, and there should be,\" said Peter Tirschwell, vice president of S&P Global Intelligence, who tracks maritime and port issues. He pointed out that President Joe Biden took time out during a trip to Los Angeles earlier this month to meet with the heads of both the ILWU and the Pacific Maritime Association (PMA), the group that represents the ship lines and terminal operators in the labor talks.\n\n\"The perception of risk is so great that the president of the United States felt he needed to meet and knock heads together,\" said Tirschwell. \"More problems at the port is the last thing he needs.\"\n\nA history of problems associated with labor talks\n\nThe PMA would not comment on the state of the talks beyond the joint statement it issued with the union. The ILWU did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nBoth Tirschwell and Larian point out that it wouldn't take a strike or a management lockout to slow or stop the flow of cargo. In the past, union members have slowed cargo simply by following strictly the terms of their existing contact, rather than trying to work most effectively.\n\n\"Maybe they won't go on strike, but they can slow down everything,\" said Larian, the toymaker CEO.\n\n\"A strike is very unlikely. A lockout is very unlikely,\" said Tirschwell. \"But there's a definite possibility of an industrial action that disrupts the flow of cargo. That's what happened for six months in 2014 and 2015 .\"\n\nThe history of talks between the two sides is another thing causing nervousness.\n\n\"It's no secret that past contract talks between PMA and the ILWU have not always gone smoothly. That's why I've heard from worried importers and exporters across our nation,\" said Jim McKenna, the CEO of PMA in a recent recorded public statement on its web site. \"I've assured them, and I'll reiterate now, that PMA's commitment is to reach a new contract with the ILWU without disruption.\"\n\nThis is prime time during the shipping season for companies that want to import goods they can sell during the year-end holiday period. Larian said he has shifted about 10% of his shipments to East Coast ports, but there are delays and higher costs involved in such a shift.\n\nHis best hope is that the union leadership won't want to cause problems for Biden, who is generally seen as the greatest friend of union labor ever to sit in the Oval Office.\n\n\"If they slow down the cargo, it will hurt the economy, hurt Joe Biden,\" Larian said. \"They're not dumb. They want to keep their biggest supporters in office.\"\n\nAutomation is key issue\n\nThe PMA said the average wages for ILWU members stands at $194,350.\n\nBut the shipping lines and terminal operators are all making huge profits thanks to a surge in cargo and very high rates.\n\nDespite tie-ups at the ports last year that caused some ships to wait weeks to unload their cargo, West Coast ports handled the equivalent of 17.3 million 20-foot containers full of freight last year, a record and up 6% from the pre-pandemic year of 2019. And cargo is up further this year.\n\nBut the ports say they need more automation to handle the increasing amount of cargo.\n\n\"We have seen...over the last 18 months that automated terminals are the most effective in handling historic volumes, while also expanding work opportunities for ILWU members,\" said PMA's McKenna in his recorded comments. The association's stats show union employment at the ports is up by more 1,000 jobs, or 7%, since 2008, when the union agreed to greater automation amid the Great Recession's economic downturn.\n\nWith shipping lines and terminals making huge profits from the current flood of cargo, the union is not inclined to give the PMA the greater use of automation that it seeks.\n\n\"Automation has gone from an issue that they conceded to employers in 2008 to an issue they militantly oppose,\" said Tirschwell.\n\nWill rank and file agree to any deal reached?\n\nAnd even if union leadership and the PMA reach a deal both can live with, will rank-and-file membership agree to such an agreement? Some deals reached between union and management negotiators at other employers have failed because union members themselves voted no.\n\nIn October, 90% of the United Auto Workers union members at farm and construction equipment maker John Deere voted down a lucrative deal that included an $8,500 signing bonus, raises of 20% during the life of the six year contract and a cost of living adjustment provision to protect them from rising prices. The members went on strike for five weeks and rejected a second tentative labor deal before finally voting in favor of a third deal and returning to work.\n\nA similar scenario could play out in the port labor talks, said Todd Vachon, an assistant professor and director of labor education at Rutgers University. He said many rank and file are not willing to accept deals they agreed to in the past.\n\n\"They're feeling pressure from inflation. And they're very accurately aware of the power they have in the economy,\" he said.\n\nSo even if union leadership wants to do their friends in the Biden administration solid and reach a deal without disruptions, Vachon added, \"the tricky part is selling that to the members.\"",

    "Container shipments into the U.S. hit a new all-time high in May 2022, making the task of managing supply chain risk much more complicated to navigate. The surge was fueled by continued strong consumer spending and a positive U.S. economic outlook for the second quarter, which combined to allay concerns about the potentially damaging ripple effects of high inflation, COVID lockdowns in China and the Russia-Ukraine war in Europe.\n\nThe June update of the logistics metrics Descartes is tracking continues to point to congestion and challenging global supply chain performance for the rest of 2022. For shippers and their logistics providers still looking for the elusive turning point for the world\u2019s supply chains, the light at the end of the tunnel remains a long way off.\n\nMay continued the record monthly trend for U.S. container import volume.\n\nHeading into the halfway mark of 2022, container imports into the U.S. set another monthly record (see Figure 1), as the TEU volume in May crept up 7% to 2,622,465 from April, eclipsing the 2.6 million TEU level for the first time. The rate of increase though might not have been as pronounced when taking into account that April is a day shorter and included the Easter holidays. In contrast to previous years, May 2022 container import volumes were up 3% from May 2021 and 26% from pre-pandemic May 2019.\n\nFigure 1: U.S. Container Import Volume Year-over-Year Comparison\n\nMay U.S. container import volumes from China were up 5.4% compared to April 2022 as COVID lockdowns began to ease especially the industrial hub of Shanghai. Compared with May 2021, however, volumes were down 2.1%, highlighting the effects of the China lockdowns. Looking at month-on-month figures, Vietnam, India, Thailand, and Thailand also performed strongly, while South Korea edged back slightly.\n\nTrade flow shifting away from top ports.\n\nThe sideways pitch and yaw in import volume swings between the top West and East Coast ports continued in May 2022, and there was more evidence of a stronger push towards smaller ports with potentially higher capacity as shippers and logistics providers played a smarter game at more effectively managing supply chain risk.\n\nComparing the top five West Coast ports to the top five East Coast ports in May 2022 versus April 2022 shows that, of the total import container volume, the East dipped to 43.6% from 45.4%, while the West edged slightly higher to 41.5% from 41.2%. The bigger story was the share of volume shifting away from the top 10 ports. In May 2022, the top 10 represented 85.1% of all volume, compared with 86.5% the month before and 86.9% year-on-year.\n\nComparing five-month periods as shown in Figure 2, top West Coast ports (orange), with the exception of Long Beach, experienced container throughput shifts to other less congested ports, including those on the East Coast. The Port of Los Angeles remained in the top spot at 496,070 TEUs in May, up ~50,000 TEUs compared with April but that was still well below its high of 530,432 TEUs in May 2021. The Port of New York/New Jersey was second at 454,749 TEUs. Long Beach held the third spot at 417,113 TEUs.\n\nFigure 2: Container Import Volume Shifts at Top 10 Ports\n\nDelay times decline but ports are bracing for peak season.\n\nThe top 10 ports all reduced delays in May (see Figure 3), compared with the month before, as the number of vessels queuing up to unload their containers fell sharply recently. For example, at the very end of May, there were 25 ships waiting to berth in Los Angeles and Long Beach, against 109 in mid-January, according to the Hellenic Shipping News, which also, however, noted upticks in the early June queue numbers in the West Coast as well as in the Gulf and East Coasts.\n\nThe welcome respite is attributed to a number of factors, including the China COVID lockdowns, shipments being redirected to less congested ports, and that the ports themselves are potentially getting better at improving container processing efficiency. While delays are declining, it must be remembered that wait times are still far off the low single digits that persisted prior to the supply chain port congestion we are now seeing.\n\nIn fact, port authorities are viewing this as the calm before the storm. With peak season just around the corner, they are bracing for the worst, especially on the West Coast if the International Longshore and Warehouse Union (ILWU) fails to agree on new contract terms ahead of the July 1st deadline.\n\nFigure 3: Top 10 Ports Monthly Average Delay (in days)\n\nManaging supply chain risk may become challenging as China eases COVID lockdowns.\n\nAs major industrial Chinese cities ease out of their COVID lockdowns, thousands of factories will resume production. And as they do, there\u2019s one thing they will likely be placing a priority on\u2014they will be working to make up for lost time. This could have a major impact on global supply chains, signaling worsening port congestion in the peak shipping season during the fall months ahead of the end of year holiday season.\n\nShanghai was the powerhouse industrial province most affected by COVID restrictions, with shipments significantly curtailed in the eight-week lockdown. As Figure 4 shows, the number of container shipments from Shanghai to the U.S. dropped 35%, comparing May 2022 with January.\n\nFigure 4: Shanghai Imports to the U.S. (TEUs)\n\nManaging supply chain risk: what to watch in 2022.\n\nThe big question on the minds of importers and LSPs is when, or if, a decline in import volume will occur in 2022. In addition, several significant one-time events could exacerbate the ability to move goods globally. Here\u2019s what Descartes will be watching:\n\n\u2022 Monthly TEU volumes between 2.4M and 2.6M. This consistently high level will continue to stress ports and inland logistics until infrastructure can be enhanced. May U.S. container import volume spiked above the 2.6M TEU level for the first time.\n\n\u2022 Port wait times. If they decrease, it\u2019s an indication of improved port processing capabilities or that the demand for goods and logistics services is declining. There was another reduction in wait times in May but with China easing COVID lockdowns, peak season just around the corner, and the ILWU negotiations ongoing, ports are better off preparing for the worst.\n\n\u2022 Continuing impact of the pandemic. The spread of COVID subvariants continues to add uncertainty to the trajectory of the pandemic and may continue to impact supply chains in unpredictable ways as different countries are affected at different times and for different durations. With COVID lockdowns In China easing recently, and with U.S. container imports hitting an all-time high in May, managing supply chain risk will likely become more complicated especially in the coming peak season in the Fall.\n\n\u2022 Key economic indicators such as the inflation rate, monthly BLS Jobs Report, FRED Inventory to Sales Ratio and FRED Personal Consumption Expenditure: Durable Goods. A fundamental change in consumer buying behavior from services to goods occurred early in the pandemic and was the force behind the dramatic increase in U.S. container import volumes over the last two years. The May jobs report showed another month of solid growth. The latest FRED numbers released in May (but are for March/April) show them to be relatively consistent with the last 12+ months.\n\n\u2022 ILWU contract negotiations. The negotiations could be uneventful or they could turn port operations and supply chains upside down in the first half of 2022 and possibly beyond. Negotiations began as scheduled in May. The Biden Administration is working behind the scenes to keep dockworkers on the job, but with the ILWU suspending talks in late May, albeit for a few days, it\u2019s still too early to say how proceedings will unfold ahead of the July 1st deadline.\n\n\u2022 Inflation and the Russia/Ukraine conflict. Inflation may be the only way to slow down the strong U.S. economy and ultimately help to alleviate the global logistics capacity-related problems that exist. In May, inflation declined slightly but still remained high and the effect of the Russia/Ukraine conflict on fuel costs continues.\n\nMay was yet another record month.\n\nMay U.S. container import volumes set yet another record versus 2021; however, China emerging from its COVID lockdowns could extend today\u2019s global supply chain challenges and drive greater uncertainty. For sure, managing supply chain risk will become more complex. This data reaffirms that it will be some time before the pressure on supply chains and logistics operations begins to lift. Descartes will continue to highlight key Descartes Datamyne, U.S. government and industry data in the coming months to provide insight into the global shipping crisis. Our current perspectives and recommendations are largely unchanged:\n\nShort-term:\n\n\u2022 Evaluate the impact of inflation and the Russia/Ukraine conflict on logistics costs and capacity constraints. Ensure that key trading partners are not on sanctions lists.\n\n\u2022 Shipping capacity constrained? Rationalize SKUs to ship higher velocity and margin goods to maximize profitability.\n\n\u2022 Focus on keeping the supply chain resources you have, especially drivers. The old adage \u201ca bird in the hand is worth more than two in the bush\u201d definitely applies here. Building trips to reduce stress and improve quality of life to retain drivers is now as or more important than wage increases.\n\n\u2022 Accelerate inventory coming in through West Coast ports now or use alternate ports as a hedge against ILWU contract negotiations that are now underway.\n\n\u2022 Track the spread of COVID variants to determine when they will hit critical parts of the supply chain. As COVID variants come in waves, they travel across the globe unevenly and create disruptions. Use tracking sites such as The New York Times to better understand their path and impact on global supply chains.\n\nNear-term:\n\nShift the movement of goods to less congested transportation lanes to improve supply chain velocity and reliability. Total transit time is important, but so is supply chain predictability. Evaluate alternative transportation lanes into the U.S., including entry through northern and southern borders and inland ports.\n\nLong-term:\n\n\u2022 Evaluate supplier and factory location density to mitigate reliance on over-taxed trade lanes and regions of the globe that are potentials for conflict. Density creates economy of scale but also risk, and the pandemic and subsequent logistics capacity crisis highlight the downside. Conflicts do not happen \u201covernight\u201d so now is the time to address this potentially business disrupting issue.\n\nSource: Descartes",

    "As supply chain upheaval shows little sign of abating, McKinsey is urging organisations to ditch out-moded and short-term strategies , and focus on proactive management, with a view to building long-term resilience.\n\nThe report says that the \u201cthe rapid decay of a decades-old model of supply chain reliability and efficiency\u201d is now a key feature of CEO agendas.\n\nThe report references the pandemic, war in Ukraine and spiralling inflation as \u201cprolonged shocks to production that have the potential \u201cto wipe out 30-50% of one year\u2019s earnings\u201d.\n\nIt adds that many of the supply shocks arising from Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine are yet to be felt, because many companies have safety stocks for exported materials, and as they get depleted disruptions will become more frequent.\n\nShort-term fixes ineffective for supply chains built on predictability\n\nMcKinsey says that in today\u2019s world, short-term, ad hoc measures to restore predictability to a supply system that was built on cost optimisation - and at a time of far greater predictability - is becoming increasingly difficult.\n\n\u201cTo restore the needed resilience, supply chain operators need to consider a range of options, including structural reform,\u201d McKinsey urges.\n\nCo-author of the report is McKinsey Partner Knut Alicke, who leads the organisation\u2019s Supply Chain Executive Academy, which stages events designed to share supply insight and expertise.\n\nHe says: \u201cStructural reform may be the only way for leaders to restore the resilience that companies depend on from their supply chains.\u201d\n\nThe McKinsey report suggests an evolutionary three-step process that can lead to \u201coptimal resilience\u201d:\n\nShort-term solutions could work at a time when supply chains were more predictable than they are today. Preparing for long-term uncertainty and possible upheaval may encourage companies to build resilience into their supply chains. This process could evolve in three stages:\n\nCross-silo strategies. Day-to-day strategies to meet demand - such as expedited delivery services - can help but don\u2019t build resilience, says McKinsey. Instead, CEOs should consider cross-silo operations for an agile response to fast-moving events.\n\nCreate a nerve centre. This is to consolidate organisational responses. McKinsey says it can coordinate and manage proactive responses to issues \u201cthat might range from caring for distressed colleagues to testing financial stability under a range of scenarios\u201d.\n\nIt suggests that such a nerve centre could be organised under four categories: people, operations, decision-enabling tools and an early-warning system to signal potential political developments, cyberthreats, or regulatory issues.\n\nBankrolling supply resilience is huge CEO challenge - McKinsey\n\nThe report concludes: \u201cCEOs recognize that none of these actions come without costs, and that it may be hard to count on long-term resilience to pay for the investments required to achieve it.\n\n\u201cAfter the experience of the past two-plus years, chief executives may need to define the circumstances in which they think consumers would pay a premium to ensure the availability of goods.\n\n\u201cThey could also consider exploring whether suppliers will accept discounts to help ensure demand for their products and absorb the costs through more productive operations. Perhaps the hardest task for CEOs could be convincing investors to accept resilience as the new table stakes and to change their view of expected risk-adjusted returns.\u201d",
    "Thursday, June 23, 2022\n\nDue to the ongoing global supply chain crisis, companies face an uphill battle managing supply chain-related issues. On one front, companies are encountering frequent and extensive shipment and delivery delays. Information from Project44, which tracks global supply chains, reveals that shipment delays between China and major United States and European ports have quadrupled since late March 2022.1 On the other front, suppliers are enduring sky-high freight costs. The cost of shipping a container on a transoceanic trade route increased seven-fold in the 18 months that followed March 2020.2 Further, within the last couple of years, several large railroad companies significantly raised rates and demurrage fees.3 Although truck freight rates have begun to pull back from historic highs,4 the United States Department of Transportation's Bureau of Transportation Statistics reported that the Freight Transportation Services Index (Freight TSI)5 for April of this year is still up 12% above the dip in for-hire freight shipments that occurred in April 2020.6\n\nBureau of Transportation Statistics, U.S. Department of Transportation, Freight Transportation Services Index, issued June 8, 2022\n\nReasons for Current Transportation Delays and Increased Freight Costs\n\nThere are three major issues affecting the state of transportation and related freight cost: the COVID-19 pandemic, the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, and shipping issues in the supply chain.\n\nThe Effect of COVID-19 on Transportation in Supply Chains\n\nCOVID-19 spurred a number of changes that greatly impacted supply chains, leading to delivery delays and increased freight costs, including:\n\nIncreased Demand for Consumer and Commercial Goods. Consumer demand for goods skyrocketed as circumstances required consumers to reduce spending on vacationing and eating out at restaurants, resulting in more disposable income for making purchases of goods.7 The appetite for products increased further as the labor force transitioned to work-from-home and spent more on new home offices and improving the home environment.8 Consumer spending on durable goods rose 30.8% from February 2020 through April 2021.9 On the commercial side, companies veered away from using just-in-time inventory management due to the delays and inability to get resources during government-imposed COVID-19 restrictions. Eyeing their depleted inventory levels, these companies began ordering more goods to have a bigger buffer stock.10 The result of this increased ordering of goods from both the consumer and the commercial sides overwhelmed an already fragile supply chain. Trucking Industry Challenges. The trucking industry has long been plagued by high turnover rates, an aging workforce, and drivers unsatisfied with the long hours away from home and uncomfortable job conditions.11 The trucking industry is highly cyclical in nature. For example, in 2019 (pre-pandemic), thousands of truck drivers lost their jobs, and the $800 billion trucking industry dipped into a recession.12 As the pandemic spread, the shortage of employees due to sickness and quarantines13 piled atop a recent wave of retirements and attrition,14 thereby exacerbating the supply chain transportation crisis in the United States. According to the American Trucking Association, in 2021, trucking companies suffered a shortage of more than 80,000 drivers.15 Shipping Industry Issues. Between 2011 and 2018, three shipping alliances increased their share of the shipping container market from 29% to 80%. These alliances currently control 95% of trans-Pacific routes. Consolidations and bankruptcies in the shipping industry made it easier for shippers to increase prices dramatically.16 In addition, shipping container shortages prevented some companies who had product available from shipping it. Chinese Factory Closures and Re-Openings. China reacted to COVID-19 with strict lockdowns that shut down entire cities, including their factories. As various Chinese cities emerge from lockdown, such as China\u2019s tech hub Shenzhen (which exited lockdown earlier this year), pent-up cargo has entered supply chain routes, exacerbating the transportation issues and leaving the question as to whether the transportation will be available to move the goods as quickly as needed.17\n\nThe 2022 Russia Invasion of Ukraine\n\nThe Russia invasion of Ukraine also increased the cost of shipping freight. Governments around the world levied embargos on Russian oil, resulting in increased costs for the remaining available fuel for purchase.18 Gas prices are not the only factor increasing overall shipping costs: the sinking of several ships in the Black Sea in connection with the Russia and Ukraine conflict has spurred insurers to hike premiums to between 1% and 5% of the value of the ship compared to pre-war levels of 0.25%.19\n\nThe fallout from the Russia/Ukraine conflict and related sanctions cannot be understated. For more information concerning the impact of the conflict on the supply chain.\n\nMiscellaneous Shipping Issues\n\nThere are a handful of other issues impacting the cost and timeliness of freight transportation:\n\nLabor Shortages. Widespread labor shortages, exacerbated further by China\u2019s zero-tolerance COVID-19 policies, are affecting the cost of transportation for consumer goods. 20\n\nPort Logjams. Port congestion continues due to perpetuating labor issues, growing container volumes, and quarantine measures in China. A future article in this Supply Chain Disruptions Series will explore how port logjams continue to impact transportation costs and delivery delays.\n\nLabor Negotiations. Unionized port workers are cognizant of the indispensable nature of the crucial role they play in global trade. Labor contracts for over 22,000 West Coast port workers (who handle approximately 42% of all US containerized trade with East Asia) are set to expire this summer. 21 Failure to resolve the labor contracts will aggravate the current port logjam issues.\n\nLack of Warehouse Space. Ship operators have diligently purchased new containers to address the lack of containers that grew out of the COVID-19 pandemic. 22 In fact, ship operators and brokers estimate that they are moving eight million more containers than before the pandemic. 23 This increase in containers led to a shortage in warehouse space to store the containers and inventory, further slowing the movement of goods along supply chains. 24\n\nReducing Risk Related to Transportation Costs and Delays As more fully discussed below, companies can use several approaches to reduce risk related to transportation delays and increased freight costs: (1) companies may try to obtain a more consistent supply by dual sourcing for their purchase of goods using geo-diverse suppliers; (2) companies may consider moving production locations to reduce the distance the product must travel; and (3) companies may evaluate their current insurance policies and commercial contracts to see if such arrangements can be adjusted to appropriately allocate delivery delay risk going forward. Dual Sourcing Beyond completely switching to domestic suppliers to obtain more consistent delivery times,companies may also consider dual sourcing (i.e., using one or more suppliers to source a material) to have a more stable supply of materials for their products. Ideally, the suppliers would be located in diverse geographies so that a weather issue or other similar event (whether shipping-related or otherwise) does not impact the supply of raw materials by all suppliers. Although companies must evaluate the cost increases associated with dual sourcing to determine whether it would be financially more beneficial than enduring the delivery delay and freight costs that occur amidst a global supply chain disruption, it is often worthwhile to identify and qualify additional suppliers in preparation for inevitable supply delays. Onshoring and Nearshoring Onshoring or reshoring refers to the practice of moving overseas production back to the domestic company\u2019s location. Nearshoring refers to the practice of moving overseas production nearby the domestic company\u2019s location, usually in a neighboring company on the same continent. Moving some or all production back to consumer markets or to a nearby region almost always results in reduced transportation costs, though those reductions must be balanced against other potential cost increases incurred in connection with moving production. Often companies find that the reliability that comes with onshoring or nearshoring outweighs any associated cost increase. Samsung, for instance, announced last year that it will build $17 billion semiconductor factory outside of Austin, Texas, as a way to increase \u201creadiness and stability.\u201d25 Similarly, Micron Technology, which is based in Boise, Idaho, announced plans to invest $150 billion globally to develop its line of memory chips, with production to be established in the United States if tax credits can make up for the higher costs of domestic manufacturing.26 Whether onshoring or nearshoring would help allay the impact of supply chain issues depends on whether the benefits of onshoring or nearshoring outweigh the loss of cheap labor provided by an overseas production system. For a pro/con analysis of reshoring and nearshoring, see Accelerating Trends: Assessing the Supply Chain in a Post-Pandemic World.\n\nInsurance Coverage\n\nCompanies should evaluate their insurance programs to determine to what extent, if any, they have coverage for goods lost or delayed in transit. When the Ever Given, a quarter-mile-long ship, became lodged in the Suez Canal in March 2021, that blockage prevented $10 billion of cargo a day from moving through the canal.27 Those companies who adequately insured their cargo were able to submit claims to cover their extensive losses stemming from the week-long delay.\n\nSome types of insurance products that could offer protection against similar supply chain delays include cargo insurance, contingent business interruption (CBI) insurance, and supply chain risk insurance. Cargo insurance generally protects shipments of goods from losses, damages, or theft sustained during transit. CBI insurance generally protects against lost profits and extra expenses incurred as the result of an interruption of business suffered by a customer or supplier. Supply chain insurance generally protects against financial losses arising from your supply chain and covers a broader swath of events than CBI insurance. Some negative events that supply chain insurance could cover include government-related disruptions, pandemics, labor issues, and financial problems.\n\nCommercial Contract Review\n\nWhenever there is a significant change in tide that affects business, companies should consider whether their contracts should be adjusted to adjust the allocation of risk or take advantage of the current business climate. Some points of analysis with respect to addressing delivery delays and freight costs include:\n\nShipping Terms. Regardless of whether a company is on the buy side or on the sell side, it should evaluate whether the Incoterms provisions or other shipping terms in its contracts are up-to-date. Common updates to Incoterms provisions include ensuring the Incoterms referenced (a) are the most recent version (Incoterms 2020), and (b) reflect the business\u2019 current practice for delivery. If the current business climate supports a shift, companies may evaluate whether the Incoterms provisions could be updated to further minimize risk of incurring unforeseen transportation costs. In an ideal world for buyers, buy-side Incoterms would be Delivery Duty Paid (DDP) at the buyer\u2019s destination, meaning that the seller is required to pay all import duties, taxes, execute customs formalities, and pay for all transportation costs.28 In an ideal world for sellers, sell-side Incoterms would be Ex Works (EXW) at the seller\u2019s dock, which places the least burden on the seller, only requiring that the seller make the goods available and suitably packaged at the specified point of delivery.29 Shipment Costs. Every contract for the purchase and sale of goods should explicitly define the extent to which each party is responsible for packaging and shipping costs. Buy-side companies typically seek transportation costs that are either included in the price of the good or are otherwise fixed costs. Sell-side companies typically seek to pass on transportation costs to the buyer, or have transportation costs subject to index adjustments such that overall pricing will adjust as overall transportation cost increases. Delivery Delay. Companies should be thoughtful about how they expect delivery delays to be handled and should update their contracts to reflect their expectations. Some questions companies can contemplate to ascertain whether their contracts should be updated as to delivery delays include: Are delivery dates approximate (as is typically desired by the seller)? Or is time of the essence as to delivery (as is typically desired by the buyer)? Who will be responsible for arranging and paying for expedited freight in the event of a delivery delay? What other remedies should be available to the buyer in the event of a delivery delay? Are these remedies exclusive (as is typically desired by the seller) or cumulative (as is typically desired by the buyer)? Will liquidated damages be imposed in the event of a delivery delay (as is sometimes desired by the buyer)? Is the provision enforceable as a liquidated damage and not as a penalty? Would it be more beneficial to have liquidated damages or contract damages? Although a liquidated damages clause helps provide clarity to the parties on damages, it also acts as a cap on damages. How do limitation of liability provisions affect the recovery of damages in the event of a delivery delay? Force Majeure. Companies should review their force majeure provisions and ensure that the terms address transportation delays caused by continued supply disruptions. Some questions to consider when evaluating force majeure provisions are: Are transportation delays, inability to obtain goods or materials, and supply chain issues considered \u201cforce majeure events\u201d? Is there catch-all phrasing that would cover transportation delays, inability to obtain goods or materials, and supply chain issues? In the event of a force majeure event, does the buyer have the right to suspend or terminate any purchase orders, and/or terminate the entire agreement under the force majeure clause? Is there a time period after the seller declares force majeure that the buyer must wait before suspension or termination?\n\nThe Future of Delivery Delays and High Freight Costs in the Supply Chain\n\nIt is uncertain when delivery delays and high freight costs will return to baseline. The consensus is clear, however, that disruptions to supply chain transportation and freight are far from over. Victor Meyer, COO of the risk intelligence provider Supply Wisdom, expects U.S. ports could begin experiencing disruptions soon as a result of Chinese port delays.30 Julie Gerdeman, CEO of Everstream Analytics, a provider of supply chain risk analytics, expects that once the Shanghai lockdown is lifted a surge of exports out of the Shanghai-Ningbo container gateway will further elongate the timeframe for supply chain disruptions.31 The CEO of Hamburg-based Hapag-Lloyd, Germany\u2019s largest container carrier, expects global supply chains disruptions will persist at least until the second half of this year.32 Companies would be wise to act now to reduce the risk of financial loss in the event of persistent transportation delays and freight cost increases.\n\nENDNOTES\n\n1 He, Laura, Shipping delays are back as China\u2019s lockdowns ripple around the world, CNN Business (May 6, 2022).\n\n2 Yan Carri\u00e8re-Swallow, How Soaring Shipping Costs Raise Prices Around the World, International Monetary Fund (March 28, 2022).\n\n3 Finn, Teaganne, Biggest railroad companies profiting from supply chain crisis, watchdog alleges, NBC News (March 7, 2022).\n\n4 O\u2019Neal, Lydia, Trucking Boom Is Hitting the Brakes as Freight Demand Slows, The Wall Street Journal (April 13, 2022).\n\n5 The Freight TSI is a weighted average of data for trucking, rail, pipeline, waterborne, and airborne freight.

    "Pandemic and war have upended American supply chains. The front-line regulators at Customs and Border Protection are warning the next shock may come from the U.S. campaign against human-rights abuses in China.\n\nA law due to take effect June 21 will bar imported goods partly or wholly made in the Chinese manufacturing hub of Xinjiang -- unless companies can prove the products have no ties to forced labor. Passed unanimously by Congress, and with strong support from unions and activists, it aims to make sure that there's no place in the U.S. economy for merchandise made by workers in detention camps.\n\nThe U.S. government isn't giving business much of a heads-up about how the measure will be enforced. At a Customs briefing on Wednesday, the message was essentially: Wait and see. That means nobody really knows how big a chunk of America's $500 billion-plus in annual imports from China could get ensnared.\n\nThat question has been the subject of a concerted behind-the-scenes campaign by corporate lobbyists and internal debates within President Joe Biden's administration -- because there's a huge amount riding on the answer.\n\nFor U.S. consumers facing decades-high inflation, stringent policing of the new law could mean another wave of shortages and price increases. Businesses such as Apple and Nike lobbied on the legislation last fall.\n\nAnd for Biden, whose Democrats must defend slim majorities in November's congressional elections, there's danger in both directions. Maximal enforcement risks a fresh supply crunch -- while soft-pedaling the measure would likely trigger charges that he's weak on China.\n\nIf enforcing the law ends up disrupting the economy, advocates say, that's a feature and not a bug -- because only a credible threat to detain imported goods will force companies to rigorously police their supply chains.\n\nStepped-up scrutiny of imports under the law \"will likely exacerbate current supply-chain disruptions,\" Customs and Border Protection said in its latest budget request. They won't be limited to goods coming from Xinjiang, or even China. All U.S. imports \"will be subject to delays in processing time,\" as officials scrutinize what they estimate will be an additional 11.5 million shipments a year, more than 10 times the previous figure.\n\nXinjiang, a province in northwest China, has long been a flash point in the escalating standoff between the world's biggest economies. The U.S. accuses China of mass detentions and other forms of oppression that amount to a genocide, and says hundreds of thousands of detainees -- mostly Uyghur Muslims or other minorities -- have been forced to work against their will. Beijing denies the allegations, saying they're part of a campaign to halt China's economic rise.\n\nLong before Congress passed the Uyghur Forced Labor Protection Act in December -- since 1930, in fact -- it's been illegal to knowingly import goods made with forced or convict labor.\n\nBut the new measure marks a major change, because it effectively shifts the burden of proof from the government to importers themselves. They must now provide \"clear and convincing evidence\" that merchandise identified as suspect by the federal government, or manufactured even partially in Xinjiang, wasn't produced with forced labor.\n\nThat amounts to guilty until proven innocent, business groups complain. Lobbyists for some of the biggest industry associations in Washington -- from the National Retail Federation to Autos Drive America -- have spent months campaigning against a hard-line approach, and urging a gradual phase-in of enforcement.\n\nSome business groups sought -- unsuccessfully -- to persuade the administration to look the other way when products have only a small overlap with Xinjiang, and encouraged it to focus on high-priority areas identified by Congress, including cotton and tomatoes.\n\n\"For the administration to move on to much more complex, value-added goods and detain those goods at the border, that would cause even more supply-chain snarls,\" said Ed Brzytwa, vice president of international trade at the Consumer Technology Association, which represents an industry that relies heavily on imports.\n\nU.S. officials have identified a wide range of goods that touch on Xinjiang at some point during their journey along supply chains. They range from gloves and sneakers to auto parts and remote-controls for televisions.\n\nThe region is also the world's top producer of polysilicon, a metal used in solar panels. That's one reason why some of Biden's climate advisers joined economic aides in seeking to narrow the scope of products under the legislation, according to people familiar with the internal discussions.\n\nBusiness groups have asked Customs to specify what kind of proof is needed to free cargoes detained at U.S. ports. But that kind of detail has been hard to come by. It's a striking contrast with the way the federal government typically implements new laws, a process that involves agencies proposing rules and inviting comment before finalizing them after months or even years of back-and-forth.\n\nThis time, initial written guidance to help importers prepare isn't expected until June 8 or after -- which many companies view as too late. Cargoes that could be subject to the measure are already en route to the United States. The government only plans to publish its broad implementation strategy, along with a list of manufacturers linked to forced labor, on June 21 -- the day it will begin enforcing the law.\n\nIn a June 1 video briefing, Customs officials acknowledged the last-minute scramble -- but rebuffed requests for more details now. Importers were advised to search the web for relevant official documents.\n\nCustoms has also written to some 2,000 companies warning that they've previously imported goods that are potentially subject to the law, but the letters didn't identify which items were implicated.",
    "Innovation is the name of the game for this past year\u2019s projects in the supply chain as the industry looks to overcome the obstacles that keep coming. While many of these problems were already headed our way, the pandemic exacerbated it all, leaving behind continued waves of new disruptions. This year\u2019s Top Supply Chain Projects were full of companies looking to solve these problems, create greater efficiency in operations and prepare organizations for continued and any new problems that can arise.\n\nTo do so, organizations in the supply chain band together to manage risk mitigation while maintaining other important parts of their organization such as ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance) growth. A recent report from Ivalua and Forrester Group showed that when looking for products and services, organizations look for innovation in procurement KPIs (57%), drive flexibility in meeting requirements (56%) and reduce pressure on cost savings (52%). Six out of 10 companies look for systems that allow them to collaborate with suppliers on product innovations.\n\nThe interest in these areas continues to increase, as 97% of supply chain companies report experiencing disruption last year in a Blue Yonder survey and 83% claim to increase investments. And, another survey from MHI and Deloitte says nearly 80% of supply chain leaders say their digital transformation has accelerated due to the pandemic.\n\nOur 2022 Top Supply Projects award\u2019s mission is to celebrate projects the most transformative and successful cases from the past year. And, this year\u2019s winners are indicative of the research mentioned above, as all of them hope to remain stronger with new investments. They showed significant results in numerous areas of the supply chain and with that came innovation to help move the supply chain forward as a whole. Listed below are some standout projects that happened within the last year.\n\nVendor: ALOM\n\nCustomer: ALOM\n\nCustomer\u2019s Primary Industry: Supply chain management\n\nTimeframe: 18-20 months\n\nBusiness Objective: Accelerated by the impacts of COVID-19 on workforce recruitment, ALOM planned, developed and implemented a multi-faceted digital transformation program that created an enhanced people management technology infrastructure. The initiative put in place integrated internal and external tools/systems to increase efficiency and reinforce its mission-driven cultural values across a new generation of workers to improve employee engagement and position the company as an Employer of Choice. The key objectives of the project were to increase efficiency and effectiveness of candidate applicant tracking/recruitment, new employee onboarding, staff development and training; modernize and integrate online payroll, benefits administration, employee 401(k) and HSA account management for geographically dispersed and growing workforce; incorporate succession planning and promotion development/readiness into individual staff development plans; expand content and improve usability for online learning management resource called ALOM University; and address employee wellness through no-cost stress and mental health education and content/resource delivery. Collectively, the successful implementation of this single initiative contributed to the ALOM team achieving record performance in 2021 in the following company and staff management areas \u2013 70% workforce growth; 60% revenue growth; 6% decrease in employee attrition 2021 vs 2018; 65% reduction in recruitment days to fill open positions.\n\nROI: ALOM was able to assemble and ship nearly 1 million COVID-19 test kits per week at the peak of the pandemic. The integrated ALOM system provides real-time notification of potential anomalies across a wide range of disruption factors. If a disruption is identified, orders may be routed to a different supplier or fulfillment location based on available capacity, proximity to delivery location or available inventory. ALOM ramped up production capacity five times the previous limit within weeks without experiencing any loss of accuracy for COVID-19 test kits. ALOM controlled productivity in spite of steep ramp and preventive pandemic measures, which typically would have resulted in productivity loss. In addition, the company took S&OP planning to the next level through mining and aggregating historical data from multiple client group programs, fulfillment locations, freight carriers and suppliers.\n\nVendor: Fine Tune Expense Management\n\nCustomer: Fortune 1000 global manufacturer of technically advanced specialty materials and complex components\n\nCustomer\u2019s Primary Industry: Business consulting and services\n\nTimeframe: April 2020 - Present\n\nBusiness Objective: Fine Tune and its client of 4.5 years\u2014a $3 billion global manufacturer of technically advanced specialty materials and complex components\u2014underwent an intensive optimization project that saved the client hundreds of thousands of dollars in uniform rental category spend. Utilizing its proprietary Expense Management Optimization and Auditing Technology (eMOAT), Fine Tune worked with the client\u2019s sourcing leaders to review spend and inventory summaries across 16 sites. Doing so uncovered and implemented substantial savings, including facility service item inventories and service frequencies, uniform quantities, direct sale/restroom product buying strategy and loss and ruin charges.\n\nROI: As a result of Fine Tune\u2019s deep dive into spend and utilization, the client company spent nearly $100,000 less in 2021 on uniform and non-garment rental than in 2020, and more than $205,000 savings is expected over the client\u2019s remaining uniform rental program term. Additionally, the project resulted in sustainability improvements\u2014an important benefit of Fine Tune\u2019s optimization projects\u2014with reductions in wasted space within facilities where unused product \u201csat,\u201d extra trips by the uniform supplier for unnecessary item servicing, uniform wash cycles and new uniforms injected into the program. Finally, the client\u2019s Commodity Manager reported an added benefit of being able to \u201cfocus on more strategic efforts across the business\u201d as Fine Tune executed and managed the project, and in everyday operations moving forward.\n\nVendor: inVia Robotics\n\nCustomer: Leading entertainment merchandise 3PL\n\n\n\nCustomer\u2019s Primary Industry: Fashion and beauty, entertainment\n\nTimeframe: April 2021 \u2013 Present\n\nBusiness Objective: This 3PL was using completely manual processes, and the warehouse team was picking at an average rate of 30 UPH. It chose inVia to implement a comprehensive warehouse execution system (WES) that could create greater efficiencies in its Carlsbad, Calif., distribution center. This project entailed using artificial intelligence (AI) to better organize storage and movement of inventory, providing tools that would help employees be more productive and using robots to automate picking and replenishment tasks to save on labor costs. Using inVia\u2019s robotics-as-a-service (RaaS) model, this 3PL was able to adopt all of these optimizations at its own pace without disrupting any of the existing operations. It started by implementing the inVia Logic WES and the inVia PickMate productivity tool. First inVia Logic identified the ideal location for inventory to store in reserve and in forward pick locations. Using inVia\u2019s system to do this was particularly important because all of the orders are e-commerce and depend on random access to all SKUs. inVia Logic also functions as the labor management system. It collects and uses data on each worker to assign fulfillment tasks, tracking elements such as pick rates, travel time and time to productivity. Furthermore, it dynamically reassigns labor throughout the day according to progress against SLAs. Additionally, employees started using inVia PickMate on their existing handheld devices to receive intuitive, step-by-step instructions to complete fulfillment tasks. This helped boost both efficiency and accuracy rates, leaving no steps in the process open to guessing. After using the software alone for 3 months and seeing doubled pick rates, the 3PL added inVia PickerWall using a fleet of 42 inVia Picker autonomous mobile robots (AMRs). This workflow leverages the strengths of robots on one side of a daily put/pick wall and the strengths of people on the other side.\n\n\n\nROI: This 3PL was able to increase productivity rates 1,000% higher than what they were achieving before implementing the inVia Robotics automation system. Before, it was averaging 30 UPH per picker, and now, averages 334 UPH per picker. This increased efficiency and reduced labor needs by 60%, which was the difference for it be able to stay in business given the tight labor market. Using the machine precision of robots to pick and putaway items also increased accuracy rates to 99.9%.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVendor: ndustrial\n\nCustomer: Lineage Logistics\n\nCustomer\u2019s Primary Industry: Energy software and technology\n\nTimeframe: January 2021 - December 2021\n\nBusiness Objective: Lineage Logistics leveraged ndustrial\u2019s nsight Coincident Peak solution to save over $2.5 million in energy savings in 2021. Additionally, the savings removed 2MW of energy off the utility grid during peak energy demand periods. To make sure the amount of electricity fed into the electricity grid is equal to the amount of electricity consumer, ndustrial specifically developed the nSight CP solution to forecast electric grid peaks, allowing factories to avoid expensive power consumption periods and to help manage the electric grid. Lineage Logistics and other facilities have increasing pressure to maintain quality production standards while simultaneously reducing their energy costs, while operating at the lowest possible cost-per-unit of production. Additionally, reducing or adjusting energy use at the right time requires a comprehensive understanding of all facilities\u2019 operational and energy patterns. ndustrial was one of the first in the industry to develop this software-only approach to help factories reduce their energy demand charges through a proprietary machine learning algorithm. Lineage notified ndustrial when their monthly peak hour was going to occur, allowing them to reduce power consumption during the predicted time window. This process enabled Lineage to proactively adjust their production schedules, cooling set points, lighting levels or any other energy consuming function during the window. At the end of each month, ndustrial matched the savings prediction against the results of their load control to calculate savings and produce a monthly report.\n\nROI: As a result of the implementation, Lineage has saved $2.5 million in energy spend in 2021 and removed 2MW of energy off the utility grid during peak energy demand periods.\n\nVendor: The Raymond Corporation\n\nCustomer: Crossroads Community Services\n\nCustomer\u2019s Primary Industry: Non-profit\n\n\n\nTimeframe: 2020 -- Ongoing\n\nBusiness Objective: Crossroads Community Services\u2019 primary objective is alleviating pockets of product insecurity in the southern sector of Dallas County as well as in Ellis and Navarro counties in Texas. Through its network of 150 distribution partners, Crossroads Community Services supplies products to low-income individuals and families in need. On Jan. 2, 2019, Crossroads Community Services moved its operation from about 10,000 square feet to 72,000 square feet. Just 14 months later, the economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic hit the Dallas area. Just as Crossroads Community Services was starting to get comfortable in the new space, it was faced with a new challenge: unprecedented demand. In April 2020, it saw the number of daily visits double overnight, distributing 900,000 pounds of product. It turned to an authorized Raymond Solutions and Support Center, Malin, to learn best practices of receiving/shipping; to maximize efficient use of the additional warehouse space and inventory control; and to safely and fully utilize all the benefits of such an amazing new distribution facility. By leveraging Raymond Lean Management (RLM) principles, Crossroads Community Services was able to optimize its order picking process, donation center methods and shopping experience as well as increase capacity in its new warehouse facility. The goal is to obtain as much relevant information as efficiently as possible and instill a culture of continuous improvement throughout the organization. During the tour of the new facility, Malin experts spotted several areas that could be optimized to increase the operational throughput. For Crossroads Community Services, these continuous improvements extended far beyond the warehouse floor. It helped identify waste and implement technology upgrades in other departments, including shipping/receiving and the pantry shopping experience. The warehouse also was able to optimize the client experience by using RLM principles to implement a one-way shopping lane. When demand increased due to COVID-19, Crossroads Community Services used RLM teachings to continue to identify waste inside its warehouse. Through this process, the organization realized it was underutilizing its space. Raymond helped Crossroads Community Services perform an audit of its current warehouse setup and identified areas for improvement. Then Raymond developed a new layout of the warehouse based on the turning radius of the warehouse fleet that included more areas for smart storage and increased racking inside its warehouse and cold storage operations. Furthermore, COVID-19 forced Crossroads Community Services to change the way it distributed product while adhering to local and federal regulations. Using RLM techniques, Crossroads Community Services designed a kit building station to assemble and package clients\u2019 orders inside the pantry. Clients were then able to safely receive product in a no-contact drive-thru.\n\n\n\nROI: RLM allowed Crossroads Community Services to identify and implement small enhancements and tweaks in its processes, which led to a tremendous impact on its production and efficiency. RLM added value to Crossroads Community Services by empowering employees to make improvements and take ownership of the tasks they accomplished daily. By teaching workers to spot inefficiencies or potential errors in their work, lean management provided practical tools to share their ideas and develop impactful, long-term solutions. Using RLM strategies and techniques to process, store and distribute product, the non-profit distributed over 2,750,000 pounds and collectively distributed 11,800,000 pounds of product in 2020. By optimizing its warehousing space, Crossroads Community Services went from 485 racking spaces to 1,032 racking spaces.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVendor: Verusen\n\n\n\nCustomer: Fortune 500 global packaging company\n\n\n\nCustomer\u2019s Primary Industry: Packaging\n\n\n\nTimeframe: 2021\n\n\n\nBusiness Objective: The Fortune 500 global packaging company was looking to offset inflation by reducing its inventories. It had just completed an acquisition and had a massive amount of relevant data living across many systems, but this data was highly disjointed, incorrect and disparate, providing an inaccurate view of inventories. This resulted in ongoing overstocking, a lack of visibility into where items are located, wasted spending and lost revenue. Using Verusen\u2019s AI platform, the packaging company could harmonize its data, creating transparency and integrity across all catalogs of data. This affected over 55 facilities and over 400,000 individual SKUs, saving the customer over $6 million in MRO space in less than 24 months. The customer was also able to identify over $21 million of verified cost reduction opportunities and over $200 million value of on-hand inventory related to MRO materials. In addition, by implementing Verusen\u2019s AI platform, the team reduced risk across the supply chain significantly. For example, one of the plants experienced two critical asset failures causing production to cease. The reliability manager could not find any available replacement parts to perform the maintenance needed to get the asset back up and running. The storeroom team first searched the plant inventory manually, with no result. Next, multiple colleagues initiated material searches within SAP, with no matching result. Finally, they contacted their manufacturer supplier and were told it would be a 4-week lead time to get the part, which would have cost over a $1 million loss in downtime. By using Verusen\u2019s AI Global Material Search capability, the company was able to locate the critical material in real-time at four sister plants, all within proximity. The material was dispositioned for overnight delivery, and the maintenance was performed, enabling the asset to be back up and running in less than 3 days with minimized downtime.",
    "The Volkov Law Group is pleased to announce our first, official summer internship program. We have welcomed a diverse group of talented, intelligent, and driven college students, who are interested in pursuing legal or compliance careers. In this blog article, our intern Abigail Schuman, a rising junior at the University of Wisconsin, discusses certain legislation aimed at combatting slave labor and human trafficking in corporate supply chains. Abby drafted this article as a precursor to an article that another Volkov Law intern will soon publish on our blog regarding the U.S. Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, which takes effect on June 21, 2022.\n\nThe Covid-19 pandemic and Russia\u2019s aggression in Ukraine have disrupted supply chains and heightened the need for supply chain due diligence to ensure business continuity and sustainability. Coupled with these events are increased social and political pressures from activist investors, environmentally and/or socially conscious employees, consumers, and other corporate stakeholders to promote Environmental, Social, and Governance (\u201cESG\u201d) goals. Now on the horizon are certain legal obligations through which national and state governments obligate private entities to combat slave labor and human trafficking in their supply chains. A significant portion of these enhanced commercial, political, social, environmental, and legal pressures now fall on corporate supply chain functions, which is why now, more than ever, companies should re-evaluate their supply chain risks, devote appropriate resources to addressing and mitigating those risks, and conduct enhanced supplier due diligence.\n\nThe California Transparency in Supply Chains Act (effective January 1, 2012) was one of the first pieces of legislation to raise awareness regarding slave labor and human trafficking in large retailers\u2019 and manufacturers\u2019 supply chains. The law was intended to enlighten consumers and businesses about corporate efforts to address human trafficking and slavery. The Act requires only disclosure, it does not regulate trade practices. The Act does not require companies to take any action to eradicate modern slavery, but instead obligates companies to disclose their efforts to do so, or the lack thereof. Companies covered by the Act must have a link on the homepage of their website, if they have one, which discloses their efforts related to five specific areas \u2013 verification, audits, certification, internal accountability, and training \u2013 or informs consumers that they have not made any such efforts. Companies that do not have a website, still need to disclose their message if requested. If companies are not in compliance with the Act, the California Attorney General may file a civil action for injunctive relief, but this author is unaware of any instances in which a California AG has done so.\n\nThe United Kingdom Modern Slavery Act 2015 basically mirrors the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act. Companies covered by this Act must \u201cPrepare a slavery and human trafficking statement for each financial year of the organisation,\u201d and must post the statement in a prominent place on their website. If a company does not have a website, it still must have a statement and disclose it pursuant to a written request. The statement must touch on six specific areas, and if it does not, it must explain why it is not included:\n\nCompany\u2019s supply chain and business structure. Policies relating to slavery and human trafficking. Slavery and human trafficking due diligences process. At-risk parts of the businesses in regard to human trafficking and slavery in the supply chain and the steps to manage the risk. Effectiveness to making sure that slavery and human trafficking is not taking place in their business and supply chains. Training staff about slavery and human trafficking\n\nPresent enforcement of the UK Act is similar to enforcement in California. The Secretary of State in the UK may initiate civil injunctive proceedings to compel a company to comply, exposing the company to potential fines for contempt of court if it then fails to comply. Last month, the UK government announced a new Modern Slavery Bill that would, among other things, authorize the imposition of civil penalties on companies that fail to comply .\n\nThe UK Modern Slavery Act and The California Transparency in Supply Chains Act set a precedent for other states and countries to follow their lead in promoting eradication of slavery and human trafficking through global supply chains. However, many commentators believe that the acts\u2019 effectiveness and impact is minimized by the lack of \u201cteeth\u201d or enforcement. Dr. Irene Pietopailu, co-author of the Modern Slavery PEC Report on the effectiveness of Section 54 of the Modern Slavery Act, for example, describes why the UK act is not likely to be as effective as laws with greater monitoring and enforcement mechanisms. She also states that the Act relies \u201cexclusively on civil society pressure.\u201d As for the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act, it too suffers from a lack of any meaningful enforcement likely to bring about meaningful change. Many criticize the California Attorneys General over the last several years for not doing more to enforce the act. It seems the legislatures and prosecutors simply are relying on private companies to act as \u201cprivate attorneys general\u201d pushing to eradicate modern slavery in their supply chains due to the social pressure of having to disclose their efforts to do so.\n\nMany countries have followed or are about to follow the lead of California and the UK. There are a lot of similarities in these countries\u2019 legislation, which shows how important anti-forced labor and human trafficking legislation is becoming globally. But there also are some differences, suggesting that global companies seeking to simultaneously comply with all laws will need to understand and address all nuances.\n\nBy way of example only, in April and May 2022, New Zealand proposed similar legislation, and the country is implementing a \u201cplan of action against forced labour, people trafficking and slavery,\u201d which sets out a five-year plan of action \u201cundertaken through strong partnerships across government agencies and with civil society, businesses, unions, academia and international partners.\u201d\n\nThe French Corporate Duty of Vigilance law passed in 2017 requires big companies to create vigilance plans, publish them, and implement them within their companies every year.\n\nThe German Due Diligence in Supply Chains Act 2021 will become effective in 2023. This law requires companies to create a system to measure risk management and include preventative measures against modern slavery.\n\nThe Norwegian Transparency Act will become effective on July 1, 2022. This Act requires covered companies to identify violations or at-risk spots in their company\u2019s supply chains and to plan to stop or reduce violations. The Act also requires a transparency report from their findings.\n\nThe Swiss Conflict Mineral and Child Labor Due Diligence Provisions took effect in January of this year but are subject to a one-year transition period. These Provisions are similar to the others, requiring a report, due diligences procedures, and measurement of effectiveness. The Swiss law also authorizes fines on those who intentionally submit false information in transparency reports.\n\nIn the U.S., other state legislatures have proposed legislation to combat modern slavery. The state of Washington, for example, proposed SB 5693, \u201cCreating Transparency in Agricultural Supply Chains,\u201d in early 2019. The Bill was reintroduced in the 202 regular session. This act would have required more transparency with respect to agricultural products.\n\nThe most recent legislative development in this area is the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act (\u201cUFLPA\u201d), which will soon become effective. This new act goes beyond simple disclosures, contains potentially stronger enforcement mechanisms, and will prohibit the importation of goods made with forced labor. On June 13, 2022, the U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency (\u201cCBP\u201d) released \u201cOperational Guidance for Importers,\u201d and CBP has offered certain webinars this month designed to help importers comply with the law. My colleague is attending the June 16, 2022 webinar, and Volkov Law intends to publish another blog article regarding compliance with the UFLPA shortly thereafter.",
    "In February 2020, MIT professor David Simchi-Levi predicted the future. In an article in Harvard Business Review, he and his colleague warned that the new coronavirus outbreak would throttle supply chains and shutter tens of thousands of businesses across North America and Europe by mid-March.\n\nFor Simchi-Levi, who had developed new models of supply chain resiliency and advised major companies on how to best shield themselves from supply chain woes, the signs of disruption were plain to see. Two years later, the professor of engineering systems at the MIT Schwarzman College of Computing and the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, and director of the MIT Data Science Lab has found a \u201cflood of interest\u201d from companies anxious to apply his Risk Exposure Index (REI) research to identify and respond to hidden risks in their own supply chains.\n\nHis work on \u201cstress tests\u201d for critical supply chains and ways to guide global supply chain recovery were included in the 2022 Economic Report of the President presented to the U.S. Congress in April.\n\nIt is rare that data science research can influence policy at the highest levels, Simchi-Levi says, but his models reflect something that business needs now: a new world of continuing global crisis, without relying on historical precedent.\n\n\u201cWhat the last two years showed is that you cannot plan just based on what happened last year or the last two years,\u201d Simchi-Levi says.\n\nHe recalled the famous quote, sometimes attributed to hockey great Wayne Gretzsky, that good players don\u2019t skate to where the puck is, but where the puck is going to be. \u201cWe are not focusing on the state of the supply chain right now, but what may happen six weeks from now, eight weeks from now, to prepare ourselves today to prevent the problems of the future.\u201d\n\nFinding hidden risks\n\nAt the heart of REI is a mathematical model of the supply chain that focuses on potential failures at different supply chain nodes \u2014 a flood at a supplier\u2019s factory, or a shortage of raw materials at another factory, for instance. By calculating variables such as \u201ctime-to-recover\u201d (TTR), which measures how long it will take a particular node to be back at full function, and time-to-survive (TTS), which identifies the maximum duration that the supply chain can match supply with demand after a disruption, the model focuses on the impact of disruption on the supply chain, rather than the cause of disruption.\n\nEven before the pandemic, catastrophic events such as the 2010 Iceland volcanic eruption and the 2011 Tohoku earthquake and tsunami in Japan were threatening these nodes. \u201cFor many years, companies from a variety of industries focused mostly on efficiency, cutting costs as much as possible, using strategies like outsourcing and offshoring,\u201d Simchi-Levi says. \u201cThey were very successful doing this, but it has dramatically increased their exposure to risk.\u201d\n\nUsing their model, Simchi-Levi and colleagues began working with Ford Motor Company in 2013 to improve the company\u2019s supply chain resiliency. The partnership uncovered some surprising hidden risks.\n\nTo begin with, the researchers found out that Ford\u2019s \u201cstrategic suppliers\u201d \u2014 the nodes of the supply chain where the company spent large amount of money each year \u2014 had only moderate exposure to risk. Instead, the biggest risk \u201ctended to come from tiny suppliers that provide Ford with components that cost about 10 cents,\u201d says Simchi-Levi.\n\nThe analysis also found that risky suppliers are everywhere across the globe. \u201cThere is this idea that if you just move suppliers closer to market, to demand, to North America or to Mexico, you increase the resiliency of your supply chain. That is not supported by our data,\u201d he says.\n\nRewards of resiliency\n\nBy creating a virtual representation, or \u201cdigital twin,\u201d of the Ford supply chain, the researchers were able to test out strategies at each node to see what would increase supply chain resiliency. Should the company invest in more warehouses to store a key component? Should it shift production of a component to another factory?\n\nCompanies are sometimes reluctant to invest in supply chain resiliency, Simchi-Levi says, but the analysis isn\u2019t just about risk. \u201cIt\u2019s also going to help you identify savings opportunities. The company may be building a lot of misplaced, costly inventory, for instance, and our method helps them to identify these inefficiencies and cut costs.\u201d\n\nSince working with Ford, Simchi-Levi and colleagues have collaborated with many other companies, including a partnership with Accenture, to scale the REI technology to a variety of industries including high-tech, industrial equipment, home improvement retailers, fashion retailers, and consumer packaged goods.\n\nAnnette Clayton, the CEO of Schneider Electric North America and previously its chief supply chain officer, has worked with Simchi-Levi for 17 years. \u201cWhen I first went to work for Schneider, I asked David and his team to help us look at resiliency and inventory positioning in order to make the best cost, delivery, flexibility, and speed trade-offs for the North American supply chain,\u201d she says. \u201cAs the pandemic unfolded, the very learnings in supply chain resiliency we had worked on before became even more important and we partnered with David and his team again,\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have used TTR and TTS to determine places where we need to develop and duplicate supplier capability, from raw materials to assembled parts. We increased inventories where our time-to-recover because of extended logistics times exceeded our time-to-survive,\u201d Clayton adds. \u201cWe have used TTR and TTS to prioritize our workload in supplier development, procurement and expanding our own manufacturing capacity.\u201d\n\nThe REI approach can even be applied to an entire country\u2019s economy, as the U.N. Office for Disaster Risk Reduction has done for developing countries such as Thailand in the wake of disastrous flooding in 2011.\n\nSimchi-Levi and colleagues have been motivated by the pandemic to enhance the REI model with new features. \u201cBecause we have started collaborating with more companies, we have realized some interesting, company-specific business constraints,\u201d he says, which are leading to more efficient ways of calculating hidden risk.",

    "A new partnership between an industry cloud provider and a global supply chain insights and risk analytics specialist will help organisations better prepare for and deal with supply chain issues.\n\nInfor has announced that it has entered into a technology partnership with Everstream Analytics to help organisations better anticipate and navigate supply chain risks and disruptions. Through the partnership, Infor will integrate Everstream\u2019s end-to-end supply chain risk assessment and monitoring data with its Infor Nexus multienterprise business network platform.\n\nThe Infor Nexus Control Center, an end-to-end supply chain control tower, provides organizations with visibility to orders, shipments and inventory throughout the supply chain \u2014 delivering intelligent, actionable insights through its connectivity to carriers, logistics service providers (LSPs), suppliers and manufacturers.\n\nEverstream\u2019s solution will complement these capabilities by providing data on external events \u2014 such as weather, labor strikes, port congestion, cybersecurity, ESG (environmental, social, and governance), and partner risks (physical and financial) \u2014 that could impact a company\u2019s supply chain flows and its ability to deliver.\n\nBy combining Everstream\u2019s risk monitoring intelligence with the other insights in Infor\u2019s digital supply chain platform, Infor will provide customers with a single supply chain control tower which provides end-to-end visibility and predictive alerts to numerous supply chain events and their impacts, helping them intelligently sense and respond to external events and ultimately deliver shipments on time and in full.\n\nBusinesses can take advantage of a single supply chain control tower which provides end-to-end visibility and predictive alerts to numerous supply chain events and their impacts.

By applying AI and predictive analytics to our datasets, we can deliver the predictive insights and risk analytics that businesses need for smarter, more autonomous and sustainable supply chains.\u201d\n\nFor example, when Everstream Analytics identifies a risk event, such as port congestion or a major weather event, it will notify the Infor Nexus platform, containing the time of the event, the occurrence duration, severity and the location. Infor Nexus Control Center will cross-reference the incident with network data to understand the impact on a customer\u2019s transactions and alert users \u2013 providing decision support tools and resolution workflow so they can swiftly take action.",
    "The business world is divided over whether the Securities and Exchange Commission should require emissions data from corporations\u2019 suppliers and customers when the agency finalizes a rule on climate-related financial risk disclosure.\n\nWhile the SEC sees broad support for its proposed rule to mandate standardized information on companies' direct emissions and other material risks from climate change, agency staff members reviewing comments face a difficult task in striking a balance in the coming months on emissions from suppliers and other third parties.\n\nA wide range of billion-dollar asset managers, investor coalitions and boutique firms focused on environmental, social and governance investing told the SEC they support the agency\u2019s provisions to include Scope 3 emissions, meaning indirect releases from supply chains. But several trade groups say there is strong opposition.\n\n\u201cThe SEC has also taken the correct approach by incorporating many of the elements set forth by the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures and by requiring disclosure of [greenhouse gas] emissions, including disclosure (for many companies) of Scope 3 emissions and third-party assurance of Scopes 1 and 2 emissions,\u201d Ceres, a nonprofit organization that works with ESG investors and companies to address climate risk and other sustainability issues in capital markets, said Friday in a letter to the SEC.\n\nOther supporters include BNP Paribas, the California Public Employees\u2019 Retirement System, Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Asset Management, Seventh Generation Interfaith Inc. and Christian Brothers Investment Services Inc.",
    "In short:\n\nClimate change is affecting every inhabited region across the globe, and its impacts go beyond the environmental effects that may immediately come to mind.\n\nThe impacts of climate change are typically split into three groups: transition risks, physical risks and opportunities.\n\nSupply chain leaders should create a sense of urgency for climate adaptation, leverage risk management and scenario modeling, and match action to risk and opportunities.\n\nThe evidence that our world is experiencing a changing climate is now undisputed. In the past year, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has issued a string of reports, each more depressing reading than the last. The message is stark: Climate change is affecting every inhabited region across the globe. This includes the United States, which experienced 20 separate billion-dollar weather events in 2021, and Australia, which has seen a 16% decline in rainfall since 1970.\n\nWatch our experts: Progress from Strategy to Action on Sustainability\n\nThe top 3 climate change impacts on supply chain\n\nWhat to do about the impacts of climate change poses a dilemma for supply chains. Should we act now or wait to see what might happen? Our research tells us that the impacts are being felt now. This transcends the environmental effects of wildfires, floods and freezes that traditionally come to mind.\n\nThe impacts of climate change are typically split into three groups:\n\nTransition risks arise from policy and market changes as we transition to a lower-carbon economy. For example, if the cost of carbon and regulations on emissions increases, fossil fuel assets may become stranded. Stranded assets are subject to premature write-down and don\u2019t yield expected financial returns.\n\narise from policy and market changes as we transition to a lower-carbon economy. For example, if the cost of carbon and regulations on emissions increases, fossil fuel assets may become stranded. Stranded assets are subject to premature write-down and don\u2019t yield expected financial returns. Physical risks can be event-driven (acute) or represent longer-term shifts in climate patterns (chronic). Event risks include floods and wildfires. Longer-term shifts include the risks of increased average temperatures, rising sea levels and chronic heat waves.\n\ncan be event-driven (acute) or represent longer-term shifts in climate patterns (chronic). Event risks include floods and wildfires. Longer-term shifts include the risks of increased average temperatures, rising sea levels and chronic heat waves. Climate change opportunities can be realized as consumer preferences for products or services change, or as new markets open for products. For example, we are seeing growth in the adoption of electric vehicles and the associated charging infrastructure.\n\nLearn more: Sustainable Business Strategy for a Positive Social and Environmental Impact\n\nI acknowledge that it can be overwhelming to consider all the risks and opportunities, but doing nothing is not an option. The impacts of climate change are only going to increase, and it\u2019s imperative we invest in what\u2019s needed to make our businesses resilient and adaptive.\n\nActions to adapt to climate change\n\nSo where do supply chain leaders start? In a recent report, Gartner introduced three key actions supply chain leaders can take to move the dial.\n\nCreate a sense of urgency for climate adaptation: CSCOs must engage with other leaders to build the business case for action by reiterating the message that inaction will lead to more frequent and increasingly costly disruptions. Work with experts to simplify the messages on climate change so that they relate to the business context. This will enable the organization to facilitate investment in solutions that manage risk.\n\nCSCOs must engage with other leaders to build the business case for action by reiterating the message that inaction will lead to more frequent and increasingly costly disruptions.

Overlay these with scenarios that define plausible versions of the future. The IPCC and World Economic Outlook provide a great starting point. Once you\u2019ve done this, assess the impacts of risks to facilitate determining an effective response. Match action to risks and opportunities: Actions on climate change fall on a continuum, starting with focused adaptation, which centers around local, site-based actions. This creates minimum capabilities to react to risk and generally comes in the form of engineered solutions and business continuity plans. This approach works well in the short term but does not guarantee long-term success.\n\nInformed adaptation comes next, with both an assessment based on revenue generated and the impacts of different scenarios on the product portfolio and footprint. The supply chain and wider enterprise focus actions based on revenue protection, not on location or site.\n\nFinally, those organizations that are both responding to risks and seizing opportunity are moving toward transformative adaptation approaches. Climate change is informing company strategy. These organizations take a long-term view of the business, with each decision weighed against its climate change impact. In this case, climate change is seen as both a near- and long-term threat and an opportunity for differentiation to achieve competitive advantage.\n\nHeather Wheatley is a Senior Director Analyst on the Gartner CSCO Enablement team. Her research interests include supply chain risk strategy, risk identification and assessment, risk reporting, sustainable supply chain and risk assurance.\n\nA version of this story was originally published on the Gartner Blog Network.",
    "President Biden on June 16 signed into law the Supply Chain Security Training Act, which requires the General Services Administration (GSA) to develop a training program for officials with supply chain risk management responsibilities at Federal agencies.\n\nThe legislation was first introduced by Sens. Gary Peters, D-Mich., and Ron Johnson, R-Wis., and passed the Senate in January.\n\nGSA will work in coordination with the Departments of Defense and Homeland Security, as well as the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to create the training program. OMB will also create guidelines for how Federal agencies adopt, use, and select employees to participate in the training.\n\n\u201cFederal employees who are responsible for buying software and equipment for the government must be able to recognize potential cybersecurity threats in these products,\u201d said Sen. Peters in an earlier statement. \u201cThis bipartisan legislation will help Federal employees deter foreign adversaries and criminal hackers from taking advantage of vulnerabilities in newly purchased technology to breach federal systems and disrupt our supply chains.\u201d\n\nThe program is designed to educate Federal employees \u2013 including those in the legislative, judicial, and executive branches \u2013 about supply chain risk management and risks throughout the acquisition cycle. The overall goal is to mitigate potential supply chain security risks in Federal acquisitions.\n\nLawmakers believe that training and preparing Federal acquisition employees to recognize and mitigate these growing threats is an essential step in preventing hostile actors from compromising America\u2019s national security.\n\n\u201cCounterintelligence training for Federal workers who buy and sell goods and services for the government is critical, especially at a time when our adversaries are aggressively and persistently attempting to breach our systems and steal information,\u201d said Sen. Johnson. \u201cThis is essential training that will help close a potential gap in our cyber and physical security defenses.\u201d\n\nThe legislation builds on an executive order from President Biden that made it easier for Federal agencies to share threat information, modernize their cybersecurity infrastructure, and enhance Federal software supply chain security in the wake of recent serious breaches.",
    "On the most recent Supply Chain Digital Show on LinkedIn, we spoke with Paul Butcher , CEO of LRQA, one of the world's leading global assurance providers. Below is an edited version of that interview.\n\nThe Supply Chain Digital Show is available on demand. The next show will be held on Thursday, 9 June at 2pm GMT, and every other Thursday at the same time thereafter.\n\nWhat does LRQA do?\n\nOur core business is helping our clients manage risk in an increasingly complex landscape. Our focus is how we help organisations manage their global supply chains and the risks that are inherent in those. We support our customers in running their business better, safer, cleaner, more resilient, and more ethically.\n\nWe were originally part of Lloyd's register. LRQA was launched as an independent business in July 2021. We bring decades of experience in the area of brand assurance, certification, cybersecurity inspection and and training.\n\nWe operate in 160 companies around the world, and the top accreditation bodies in the world recognise us and the services we provide. Most importantly, over half of the world's top 200 companies trust us to help them with their brand assurance needs.\n\nWhich element of ESG is most damaging to a brand, when transgressed?\n\nTo me, it's very clear that all three of those matter. Wherever a business is at any one time, one of those elements of ESG will probably have greater or lesser significance. That's the nature of the changing environment our clients are operating in. Businesses don\u2019t have the option of ignoring any one of them. They\u2019re crucial,\n\nTake greenwashing as an example. I was reading today how Elon Musk is upset that Tesla had been bumped out of the top 10 ESG ratings but that six oil companies are ranked in the top 10. This comes to one of the challenges we have around the whole question of, of greenwashing. Can we truly rely on the claims organisations are making about their green and environmental credentials? For us, the key to this is data; those claims need to be verified.\n\nAnother challenge we see is around the area of forced labour, and organisations making sure that they are addressing this issue in their supply chain, right down to their suppliers\u2019 suppliers.\n\nESG risks increase during times of supply disruption because businesses are more likely to be changing suppliers, and without visibility across the value chain this can mean they don't really know what\u2019s happening in your supply chain. This is even more true now, with the war in Ukraine.\n\nThe challenge we see for organisations is not just whether consumers will buy your product if they feel you are not ESG compliant, but also whether other companies will partner with you or not.\n\nAnd then there is the battle for talent, and recruitment. People are making very deliberate choices about the organisations they're willing to work for. They want to work for an organisation that's focused on ESG, and that wants to do the right thing.\n\nThen there\u2019s the risk from legislative change. The German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act comes into effect next year, and it's going to force organisations doing business in Germany to manage their social and environmental issues. And in US, the Uyghurs Forced Labour Prevention Act comes into effect on June 21 (2022). Shipments will be seized if companies are not able to demonstrate that they're ensuring products are not coming from Xinjiang in China.\n\nSo there is real pressure on organisations to make sure they're managing all these risks across every aspect of their supply chain.\n\nThat's where we play a crucial role, in terms of helping them not only put in place the policies and procedures, but also being able to independently verify what is happening on the ground. We go in, we verify it and we give them the comfort that what a company is claiming it is doing around ESG is actually happening.\n\nWhere do you see supply chain ESG risk being in 5 years?\n\nThere\u2019s two things on this. One thing that gives me a sense of optimism is that I am already seeing businesses step up to the challenge. With the pandemic and now Ukraine, we have an existential threat to the world. We know we need to act. Inevitably, politicians and governments have been slow to act, but businesses are stepping into the breach because they want to do the right thing .\n\nSo I see business playing a leading role in helping address more of these challenges. We will continue to see disruption and with it, the importance of organisations having the necessary levels of agility and innovation to respond to these challenges. What we will see is an even greater role for digital, a process accelerated by the global pandemic.\n\nWe're already seeing new ways in which data is used to monitor what's going on in real time - to identify potential issues before they arise - a process of audit, inspection and intervention. Going forward, we're going to see much more of this, and it will be of a better quality, and richer.\n\nDo we need global ESG laws, rather than regional?\n\nA multi-layered approach is what\u2019s important. It's great to see governments taking action because that helps. Our business has grown up on the back of international standards and regulations facilitating global trade and we are a great believer in standards as a way of driving consistency of performance. It's not just about legislation. It needs also to be about the adoption and use of standards - and of course also independent verification, which companies like LRQA bring to the table.\n\nUltimately, it's a combination of all these factors and also organisations doing the right thing, by putting pressure on suppliers to behave in a particular way, to align to their brand standards.",

Each risk is scored and ranked to identify suppliers\u2019 strengths and weaknesses. The framework provides a common vocabulary of supply chain security risks that can be understood across suppliers, supplies, and services, reducing communication barriers and the potential for misunderstanding.\n\n\u201cSystem of Trust identifies risks and encourages decision making using a data-driven approach,\u201d Masters added. \u201cMITRE works to bring innovation and data together for the public good, and we\u2019re excited to see how the cyber community utilizes System of Trust to take risk mitigation to the next level.\u201d\n\nMITRE will launch the System of Trust website at RSA and follow up with a Supply Chain Summit on July 27.\n\nMedia: Lisa Fasold or Priya Madrecki, media@mitre.org",

    "The war in Europe, inflationary pressures, and the ongoing fallout from a global pandemic are all contributing to supply chain disruption across many industries. Insureds need a risk management partner who can meet their needs as a consultant, in addition to providing tailor-made coverage.\n\nSupply chain risk is not a new concept to underwriters or risk managers. But it\u2019s no exaggeration to say that the degree to which supply chain problems are now impairing the operations of businesses across many sectors is unprecedented in our lifetimes.\n\n\u201cI read the other day that something like 95% of Fortune 1,000 companies have reported significant disruption from supply chain right now. That\u2019s about as systemic as you can get,\u201d said Seth Hedrington, Senior Vice President, Major Accounts \u2013 Risk Management at Liberty Mutual.\n\nSupply chain issues affect not only the ability of businesses to receive vital materials, they also impede their ability to fulfill their contracts and deliver goods to their end customers.\n\n\u201cThe broader risk management concerns involve supply chain uncertainty, quality control, and contract liability. Talent risk is also a factor, given to what degree labor shortages are impacting manufacturing, construction, hospitality, retail and a host of other industries,\u201d said Heath Kidd, Vice President, Industry Solutions for Liberty Mutual. \u201cIt\u2019s really hard to overstate just how pervasive these issues are across industries and the risk landscape.\u201d\n\nDifferent causes, similar solutions\n\nThe reasons why we\u2019re seeing supply chain disruptions to this degree are many and varied and they overlap in some cases. But chief among them are an ongoing global pandemic, war in Ukraine, and the aforementioned labor shortages and inflationary pressures that are driving up the costs of materials for numerous industries.\n\nRegardless of the causes of supply chain disruptions, yesterday, today, or in the future, the approach to managing these risks holds true over time and across sectors.\n\n\u201cI think a lot of companies have been taken off guard with the severity of the supply chain issues they are facing and don\u2019t want to get burned again. Managing supply chain risk can and should be a proactive risk management decision. And it goes beyond insurance coverage. There are a lot of operational considerations that can help mitigate the risk significantly, and we\u2019re seeing many of our customers taking those steps,\u201d said Hedrington.\n\nThere will be those that take little action, and that is a legitimate choice, but they should understand that they\u2019re essentially self-insuring against that risk. It comes down to a business decision.\u201d he added.\n\nFour key mitigation measures to manage supply chain disruption\n\n1) Vet your extended supply chain. \u201cFirst and foremost, companies should be thinking about supply chain vetting,\u201d Hedrington explained. \u201cAnd in many cases, that can be a pretty long chain; longer or more complex than you might expect.\u201d He outlined that most companies have traditionally studied their key suppliers to gauge whether they can deliver vital goods and services when and where they say they can.\n\nBut he said it\u2019s not as common for companies to vet their secondary and tertiary suppliers.\n\n\u201cI think one of the key mitigation techniques is expanding your view of what the supply chain really is beyond those primary suppliers,\u201d Hedrington said.\n\nThat includes vetting suppliers, especially when onboarding new vendors to meet material shortfalls from existing vendors or seeking to diversify suppliers. Businesses might also want to consider ensuring that supply chain partners include the business as an additional insured on general liability policies, Kidd said.\n\nCommunication with the insurers and brokers of suppliers at every tier should be open and as frequent as possible to make sure that all stakeholders are responding to this increased supply chain risk and managing their operations accordingly, he added.\n\n2) Reassess your business continuity plan. A second key factor, Hedrington said, is maintaining an up-to-date and quality control-focused business continuity plan.\n\n\u201cDoes your business continuity plan include where you will source key materials if a primary supplier dries up?\u201d is a question Hedrington posed.\n\nHe also explained that many companies may be considering material substitutions to adapt to shortages, but that this can carry unaccounted for risks.\n\nMany of us remember the notable substitution of Chinese drywall after the American made drywall supply ran out due to the rebuilding demand after several severe hurricanes hit the Southeast. The Chinese drywall that was used to build thousands of homes there between 2002 and 2007 was found to be defective, causing health issues and property damage.\n\n\u201cMake sure you proactively have and maintain relationships so you can go to a secondary, even a third source as needed,\u201d Hedrington said.\n\nKidd noted that product liability and product defect claims can have serious consequences and long tails.\n\nBeyond taking all the preventive measures to ensure the quality of materials, that also means developing plans to respond to situations where a substituted material isn\u2019t up to snuff and anticipating how to manage the fallout.\n\nAnalyzing to what degree labor shortages could impact quality is also something to keep in mind given the challenges many businesses are facing in finding skilled workers and keeping their operations fully staffed.\n\n3) Re-evaluate inventory management. A third mitigation technique, and one that represents a significant change in how companies operate their businesses, is inventory management.\n\nThere was a time in the not-too-distant past that just-in-time delivery was all the rage in manufacturing, retail, and other sectors. The logic was that companies could save money by ordering and receiving the products they needed within a predictable target date, forestalling the need to tie up capital in extensive inventory levels. But it has left a lot of businesses empty handed amidst the recent challenges to the supply chain.\n\n\u201cHealthcare and the crisis of PPE, even ventilators, in the early days of the pandemic are examples of this vulnerability,\u201d said Kidd. \u201cMany, probably most, hospitals didn\u2019t have enough protective equipment available during the first surges of the virus. Because of the lead times and supply chain issues, you just couldn\u2019t get them. A lot of them are rethinking that.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow the same thing is happening across all sorts of industries, and that applies to raw materials, as well as parts and equipment. Many businesses are trying to offset this risk by keeping more items on hand. But this introduces some other risks that insureds may not be thinking about.\u201d\n\nFor example, as inventory levels rise many businesses are faced with warehousing constraints. It\u2019s important to consider other related issues, like scaling property coverages to match what\u2019s on-hand, as well as maintaining up-to-date appraisals to ensure coverage is adequate.\n\n4) Proactively manage contracts. A fourth technique is contract vigilance and flexibility. Widespread supply chain disruption means that many companies are at risk of not being able to deliver goods and services at the price level and delivery date they promised.\n\n\u201cA lot of companies right now are scrambling because they\u2019re potentially facing breach of contract issues,\u201d Hedrington said.\n\nTheir contracts weren\u2019t flexible enough so that if they came up against adverse conditions, they\u2019d have some wiggle room.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re having them proactively look at that as another non-insurance technique as well,\u201d Hedrington said.\n\nThis should include a sober assessment of a company\u2019s ability to complete projects on time, within contract specifications, and on budget. Breach of contract or financial performance issues can result in professional liability claims. It\u2019s important to continually assess the adequacy of coverage and adapt to reflect the changing environment, even with the knowledge that these types of claims tend to have long tails, so the true impact may not be seen for some time to come.\n\nA productive partnership\n\nWhether it be a need for supply chain vetting, strengthening a business continuity plan, identifying alternate suppliers, or analyzing the suitability of customer contracts, Liberty Mutual is working with customers and brokers to help see them through this period of disruption, they said.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s at times like this that you come to really appreciate those collaborative partnerships. Maybe the whole lesson of all this is just how interconnected business is today. No one is going to be able to get through this alone. That applies to insurance and is why it\u2019s so important to have a team that can bring the best insights to those planning conversations and offer the risk control guidance that can help minimize some of these impacts in the future,\u201d said Kidd.\n\n\u201cWhere we differentiate ourselves, beyond the products and services we offer, is that we meet clients where they are from a risk perspective and truly help them fill in the gaps,\u201d Hedrington said. \u201cWe are partners in all areas of risk management, not just the product [insurance coverage] side of things,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cWe incorporate feedback based on what we\u2019re seeing, what the claims data is telling us, and what our customers are experiencing in the market and then respond to that with industry insights, trends \u2014 observations that then allow us to inform a better process going forward,\u201d Kidd said.\n\n\u201cI think that\u2019s what sets Liberty apart. And I think that allows us to be in tune with what our customers need and be responsive to the demands in the marketplace.\u201d\n\nTo learn more, please visit https://www.business.libertymutual.com/.\n\nThis article was produced by the R&I Brand Studio, a unit of the advertising department of Risk & Insurance, in collaboration with Liberty Mutual Insurance.

    "ROSH HA\u2019AYIN, Israel and NEW HAVEN, Conn., May 25, 2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Source Defense, a pioneer in web application client-side protection, today announced the results of a study, Third-Party Digital Supply Chain Risk: Exposing the Shadow Code on Your Web Properties, that for the first time sizes the security, privacy, and compliance risks that are literally designed into the digital supply chains of major business websites. This risk, originating from highly dynamic and unpredictable scripts and code from third parties and beyond, permeates every aspect of a business\u2019s web presence. On the whole, this report sheds light on a woefully underestimated risk that most famously resulted in the theft of financial and personal information for more than 400,000 British Airways passengers in 2018, and resulted in the largest fines ever from the British Information Commissioner\u2019s Office (ICO).\n\n\n\nOrganizations collecting sensitive information, enabling business transactions or conducting commerce through their web properties, are under a constant risk of attack. The pace of adversarial activity is only increasing as retail and e-commerce companies enjoy exponential growth, as travel and lodging needs increase post-pandemic, and as healthcare and financial services transactions move more critical and sensitive functions online.\n\nThe top line report findings discovered an average of 15 externally generated scripts on each site, with an average of 12 scripts specifically on sensitive pages. Financial services was the most exposed vertical, with nearly 60% more scripts on average resident on sensitive pages, and double the number per page overall, with triple the amount of fourth-party scripts. The data comes from an analysis of 4,300 of the world\u2019s largest websites across the most prevalent verticals during the first quarter of 2022 to identify both security and compliance issues lurking within the website digital supply chain. The company mapped the concerning sprawl of third- and fourth-party scripts across each website, on individual pages \u2013 including sensitive pages that come in contact with PII, financial data, etc. \u2013 and the usage and variance across the most prevalent verticals.\n\n\u201cWhile retail and credit card breaches grab the most headlines, this is a pervasive and relatively unchecked risk to both security and privacy across all verticals,\u201d said Dan Dinnar, CEO of Source Defense. \u201cIt\u2019s also a fast-growing and extremely volatile issue with regard to sensitive data. Organizations and their digital supply chain partners are constantly updating sites and code, and the data of greatest value to malicious actors is collected on the pages where the business has the greatest need for analytics, tag management, and other tracking and management capabilities.\u201d\n\nExtensive libraries of third-party scripts are available free, or at low cost, from a range of communities, organizations, and even individuals, and are extremely popular as they allow development teams to quickly add advanced functionality to applications without the burden of creating and maintaining them. These packages also often contain code from additional parties further removed from \u2013 and farther out of the purview of \u2013 the deploying organization. Making matters worse, they operate remotely from a server belonging to the third party, to provide everything from social media connections to marketing tracking/analytics. If a script has been compromised, the shadow code comes with it and goes straight to the browser without organizational defenses able to detect it. From there, scripts can exfiltrate data to remote servers, redirect users to malicious websites, or lay the groundwork for formjacking, digital skimming, and credential harvesting attacks.\n\nIn analyzing the potential external script threat surface, Source Defense found additional risks including:\n\nNearly half of all sites (49%) had external code present with the ability to retrieve form input and \u201clisten\u201d to user button clicks, and more than one in five sites had external code with the ability to modify forms.\n\nOn average, one in four of all scripts represented fourth-party code, as did every one in five scripts on individual pages.\n\nPer page, analysis found an average of five scripts, with at least one a fourth-party script. The number was much larger on sensitive pages, at an average of 12 external scripts in contact with everything from credentials to account and financial details.\n\nThe two most exposed verticals were financial services and healthcare, with an average of 16 and 13 third-party scripts, and 6 and 5 fourth-party scripts, respectively. And on sensitive pages, analysis found an average of 19 scripts in financial services and 14 scripts in healthcare.\n\nFor more information, please download the Source Defense report.\n\nAbout Source Defense\n\nSource Defense is a security and compliance platform for any website that collects sensitive data or is transaction-oriented.

    "From today (June 22) US Customs will begin enforcing the Uyghur Forced Labor Protection Act (UFLPA), banning all imports from Xinjiang Province in China.\n\nThe new law - signed into law by President Biden on December 23, 2021 - is even more stringent than legislation that was passed in the wake of the 9/11 Twin Tower terror attacks in the US, following which the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) was passed, to combat money laundering and the financing of terrorism.\n\nPenalties for a UFLPA violation will be high, involving civil or criminal penalties, or both. Not only will impacted goods be seized at the border, but the resulting disruption and reputational damage is likely to be severe, and lasting.\n\nAccording to the legislation, \u201cany goods, wares, articles, and merchandise mined, produced, or manufactured wholly or in part in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region are not entitled to entry to the United States\u201d.\n\nImports from Xinjiang will be permitted only if the Commissioner of US Customs and Border Protection determines that the importer \u201chas clear and convincing evidence\u201d that the goods were not produced using forced labour.\n\nUyghur imports law threatens to disrupt US supply chains\n\nAmnesty International claims Chinese authorities have created a \u201cdystopian hellscape on a staggering scale\u201d in Xinjiang, involving abuse of the Muslim Uyghur population in the area, including mass surveillance, detention, and forced labour.\n\nDespite this, companies including Apple, Nike and Coca-Cola have previously lobbied against the bill , citing concerns over how it would affect business, according to the New York Times.\n\nBut now, for major global brands and smaller businesses alike, the Act will ensure that compliance is prioritised, as ESG policing and enforcement is ramped up.\n\nSupply chain analysts say that, in the coming months, a deal of supply chain chaos will ensue, as businesses with supply chains that extend into China gauge the potential impact on direct and indirect reliance on suppliers in China.\n\nBrandon Daniels is CEO of Exiger, a company that helps organisations manage supply chain risk. he told Supply Chain Digital that the downstream impact of the legislation will potentially be \"vast\".\n\nHe said: \"Regulators and federal authorities will take enforcement seriously. The fashion, retail, computing and alternative energy sectors will be hardest hit. They have been reliant on artificially cheap goods from forced labour in China, a practice that is economically and ethically intolerable. So, if you are wearing a shirt that is made in China, have a phone screen that could have been made in China, or are using a solar panel on the top of your house where the photovoltaic cells were made in China, they will be impacted by this law.\n\nUFLPA 'will see businesses prioritise ESG compliance' - Exiger\n\nDaniels added that, while the law could potentially see \"the arrest of billions of dollars of product\" companies would be \"unlikely to let it get this far\". He added that he expects to see organisations \"prioritise compliance and invest in efficient ways to manage the due diligence requirements\".\n\nDaniels also says that as well as challenges in complying with the law, there will also be \"opportunities for growth and economic rebalancing\".\n\nHe said: \"The reshoring of major components of the supply chain will increase the diversity and resilience of the supply of rare earth minerals, textiles and polysilicon. These are core materials for every market, from healthcare to cloud hosting.\n\n\"This will also inspire and fund innovation across the Democracy 10 to identify new methods for sourcing, refining and manufacturing the materials that will fuel the future of space exploration, defence and telecommunications. It this also create expansion opportunities in emerging markets in Asia, Africa and the Americas. It is a step towards a fair and ethical world that prioritises a free market not warped by the fabricated and unsustainable price of forced labour.\n\nFor the fashion sector - which historically has a poor ESG record - the UFLPA legislation follows related legal moves to pass a city-specific US law to police sustainability best practice when it comes to fashion imports.",
    "RESTON, Va. & ARLINGTON, Va.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Mandiant, Inc. (NASDAQ: MNDT) and Interos, the fast-growing operational resilience company, today announced a strategic partnership to provide advanced insights and analysis to help enterprises defend against cyber attacks and other threats to their operational resilience. The collaborative partnership is designed to bring to market new intelligence based on insights gleaned from the Interos Resilience Lab, as well as Interos\u2019 SaaS platform, and the frontline investigations and remediations Mandiant conducts regarding high impact cyber attacks worldwide.\n\nMandiant M-Trends 2022 report shows that global supply chains remain an attractive target for threat actors who seek to take advantage of trusted business-to-business relationships, as attacking the supply chain provides an opportunity to pivot from one supplier network into multiple customer networks at once. In fact, when the initial infection vector was identified, supply chain compromise accounted for 17% of intrusions investigated by Mandiant in 2021, compared to less than 1% in 2020.\n\nFurther, new data from Interos\u2019 2022 Annual Global Supply Chain Report reveals that organizations have been impacted by on average three significant supply chain disruptions within the last 12 months (not including the Ukraine war) \u2013 costing a combined $182 million in lost revenue. Cyber attacks account for $37 million of that figure. Additionally, the overwhelming majority (91%) of executives reported that their organizations had experienced supply chain disruptions from Tier 2 and Tier 3 suppliers in their extended supply chain.\n\n\u201cInteros is focused on helping organizations ensure operational resilience; continuously delivering in-depth analysis on criticality for risk, and risk management,\u201d said Marshall Heilman, Chief Technology Officer, Mandiant. \u201cTogether with Interos, Mandiant will be able to proactively problem solve with a company that is leading the way in ensuring organizations of all sizes understand key attack vectors across supply chain, threat actors and nation state threats.\u201d\n\nThe partnership announcement follows a recent alert from the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) warning of an increase in malicious cyber activity targeting managed service providers (MSPs). The advisory also recommended MSPs to understand and proactively manage their supply chain risk.\n\n\u201cThe CISA warning is more evidence that existing supply chain risk management systems were not designed for today\u2019s complex risk environment,\u201d said Nishant Gupta, Chief Technology Officer, Interos. \u201cOur collaboration with Mandiant will provide multi-factor risk intelligence to help commercial and government organizations better protect targeted entities in their third-party relationships to insulate them from disruption, ransomware, and IP theft. We\u2019re proud to partner with Mandiant to help leaders discover hidden business relationships and exposure to cyber vulnerabilities.\u201d\n\nAbout Mandiant, Inc.\n\nSince 2004, Mandiant has been a trusted partner to security-conscious organizations.

    "SAG Logo\n\nREA is pleased to announce it has been assigned patent number, 11,374,961, with an issuance date of June 28, 2022 for its Software Assurance Guardian (SAG\u2122)\n\nWe are actively in discussions with larger, better resourced organizations with an interest in taking the SAG patent and the SAG-PM software product to the next level.\u201d \u2014 Joanne Brooks, REA Co-Founder\n\nWESTFIELD, MA, USA, June 8, 2022 / EINPresswire.com / -- Today, REA is pleased to announce it has been assigned patent number, 11,374,961, with an effective issuance date of June 28, 2022 for its Software Assurance Guardian (SAG\u2122) METHODS FOR VERIFICATION OF SOFTWARE OBJECT AUTHENTICITY AND INTEGRITY for software products and the software supply chain (C-SCRM). REA was motivated to develop this patented technology to assess risk and trust in a software supply chain starting in November, 2018 after the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) issued Order 850, \u201cSupply Chain Risk Management Reliability Standards\u201d [18CFR40] to protect the bulk electric grid from software supply chain risks.The SAG patent describes seven steps containing detailed, technical practices and processes that are designed to help a software consumer determine the trustworthiness of a software object and its entire supply chain, expressed as a statistically calculated SAGScore\u2122, to make a risked based decision prior to procurement and installation of a software product, to proactively detect and prevent a cyber-attack. Evidence data is collected in thirteen separate files, as proof that cybersecurity controls are implemented and effective, for audit purposes. These patented SAG\u2122 methods have been implemented in REA\u2019s flagship software risk assessment product, the Software Assurance Guardian Point Man\u2122 ( SAG-PM \u2122), which was first announced in April 2021, and now stands at version 1.1.8. Now, software consumers can reliably and consistently assess the trustworthiness of a software product and its entire supply chain using patented methods that apply best practices within each of the seven SAG risk assessment steps resulting in a trustworthiness SAGScore\u2122.SAG-PM\u2122 was created to provide affordable and effective software supply chain cybersecurity protections to small and medium businesses (SMB) operators of critical infrastructure that may lack cybersecurity skills on staff. SAG-PM\u2122 implements best practices following Cyber Supply Chain Risk Management (C-SCRM) guidelines provided by the National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) in SP 800-161r1. SAG-PM has evolved to satisfy requirements of NERC CIP and the Cybersecurity Executive Order issued on May 12, 2021 (# 14028) following NIST\u2019s implementation guidelines for Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) and Vulnerability Disclosure Reports (VDR) issued on 5/5/2022, required to meet the Executive Order, ref: NIST RECOMMENDATIONS . A VDR is an attestation by a software vendor that they have checked each component of a software product in an SBOM for vulnerabilities and reports on the vulnerability status of each component, for a software product.

    "Elvire Boinet-Bondon is European Advisor of Business Development, Graphite Connect. She spoke to Supply Chain Digital Editor in Chief Sean Ashcroft at the Procurement & Supply Chain LIVE Show in London, in April 2022.\n\nTell us a little of Graphite Connect\n\nGraphite Connect is a US-based startup. It\u2019s a supplier life-cycle and risk management solution that saves suppliers from endless and redundant onboarding surveys, and buyers from managing inaccurate vendor master data.\n\nWe believe that forcing suppliers to start every engagement with blank forms is a waste of everyone\u2019s time. Our network-based platform makes it simple and secure for buyers and sellers to connect and share critical data, documents, and assessments.\n\nWhat messages are crucial in procurement right now?\n\nProcurement teams are facing a credibility crisis. Business continues to speed up but purchasing is slowing down, and the issue is supplier onboarding and the associated due diligence.\n\nThese emerging reputational and regulatory risks are critical new value-streams for procurement. But teams and technology have\u2019t adapted with automated processes and technology to address these new process requirements within the required speed of business.\n\nAs businesses require more flexibility and speed this slowdown is eroding procurement\u2019s reputation across organisations, and is causing other departments to work around procurement. Early inclusion of procurement in key deals is decreasing.\n\nWhat is the biggest with supplier onboarding?\n\nThe biggest problem is there is an increasing scope of data, documents and due diligence required by cross-functional teams and regulations.\n\nIn the UK, General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) brought this issue to the surface. Generally, data privacy, information security assessments cause huge process delays.\n\nBut ESG concerns are rapidly becoming a reputational and regulatory concern, so due diligence isn\u2019t going to go away. It\u2019s growing.\n\nThis is why onboarding must transition to a network-based architecture that eliminates work. Social networks have proven efficient information sharing platforms in our personal life, but B2B hasn\u2019t evolved with the same efficiency. Graphite is the first supplier onboarding solution that is built on social network architecture.\n\nIt automates supplier responses. Graphite also automates the scoring of assessments, and validates all commercial data. We can\u2019t accept that it\u2019s normal for onboarding to take months. It needs to take minutes.\n\nWhat tech is Graphite Connect based on?\n\nGraphite is built as a modern cloud SaaS solution. We leverage Google Cloud Platform, MongoDB, ElasticSearch, and other modern services to create a high availability, high scalability, global solution.\n\nGraphite works like LinkedIn. But, rather than connection professionals. Graphite connects companies. As buying organisations require suppliers to provide onboarding data and documents through Graphite, the supplier\u2019s profile organically grows.\n\nNew customer requests asking for existing information are automatically matched with approved profile responses to eliminate redundant supplier responses, which massively speeds up the process.\n\nSince the data and documents requested at onboarding must be validated regularly, Graphite enables suppliers to continue to manage their data without blank forms for every refresh and update.\n\nAll data is protected with the highest levels of security and multi factor authentication to enable the most robust protections against today\u2019s prevalent fraudulent changes of supplier bank data.\n\nIs it hard getting suppliers to engage with onboarding solutions?\n\nNo. Suppliers face constant demands to provide commercial and risk assessment data and documents. They actually love the progress away from paperwork. Everyone appreciates a process that only requires what\u2019s specifically needed in the situation.\n\nThere is no charge for suppliers. We have great feedback from supplier participants. The supplier network is rapidly growing. We expect it to grow by a factor of 20 this year.\n\nOccasionally suppliers or payees refuse to respond with some or all of their information but Graphite enables fully buyer-managed payee records for utilities, tax authorities and other non-participants.\n\nCan you onboard suppliers efficiently without tech?\n\nWe onboarded suppliers in the 80s and 90s with fax machines. Email is the new fax machine and is the primary tech used to onboard suppliers today. While these manual processes can work, they present blank forms and almost no automation.\n\nThe huge redundancy and lack of automation in the process makes onboarding much too slow and layered with bad data. Processes can be be optimised only so much without better technology\n\nWho inspires you?\n\nBoth of my grandmothers. They went through so much in their lives - war and the loss of a child. They were both entrepreneurs and had great management skills. They kept smiling, and created bonds with everyone.\n\nBest piece of advice ever given?\n\nWhatever situation you are dealing with, believe in yourself and trust in the future.",
    "Thomas Barwick/DigitalVision via Getty Images\n\nThe Ukrainian supply chain issue will remain the main upside risk to food inflation in the coming months even with significant increase in shipments from Danube ports; total volume is too small to offset the loss of cargo from Ukraine.\n\nFollowing the inflation and food crisis, there are several discussions on how to export or move the Ukrainian grain, and other cargo. We have already seen a significant increase in shipments from Danube River ports in Ukraine and Romania. However, most of the shipments are done by small ships less than 10,000 dwt, therefore the total volume is too small to offset the loss of the cargo, at least for now.\n\nRecent news about silos on the borders with Ukraine to use inland transportation more efficiently is gaining more attention now. However, in our view, it will take months to procure equipment, move it into place, construct, and make it operational.\n\nTherefore, the grain volume during the Black Sea grain season starting from the third quarter will be fairly limited and the shortage of world grain, especially wheat, is expected to continue in the near term. This supply chain issue will remain the main upside risk to food inflation in the coming months.\n\nFollowing the Russia-Ukraine war, dry bulk and general cargo vessel (which can carry grain cargo) departures from Ukrainian and Romanian Danube River ports have increased by 53% from a month ago to 1.8 million deadweight tons in May 2022 with larger employment of small general cargo ships. However, total volume is limited to offset the loss of Ukrainian cargo. Combined capacity of dry bulk and general cargo ship departures from Ukraine has decreased by 92% from year-ago level (10 million deadweight) to below 1 million deadweight tons.\n\nTransporting Ukraine's agricultural products by rail to ports in Romania is costly and time consuming; The railway border crossings have limited capacity for rail wheel replacement, as Ukraine rail (1,520 mm gauge) infrastructure links to Russia rather than Romania (1,435 mm gauge).\n\nTemporary silos built along the border with Ukraine would increase export volume via alternative ports including Danube River ports but not significant in the near term since silos on the borders will take months to procure equipment, move it into place, construct, and make it operational, according to S&P Global Agribusiness intelligence team.\n\nOriginal Post\n\nEditor's Note: The summary bullets for this article were chosen by Seeking Alpha editors.",

    "While many cybersecurity officials strive to achieve \u201cno risk\u201d when it comes to cyber risk management, officials from NASA this week explained that\u2019s just not possible and suggested that agencies instead focus on managing risks that are important to the mission.\n\nAt the NASA SEWP (Solutions for Enterprise-Wide Procurement) SCRM Hybrid Forum 2022 on May 24, Joanne Woytek, program manager for the NASA SEWP program, explained how cyber risk management does not mean achieving zero risk.\n\n\u201cRisk is the important word,\u201d Woytek said. \u201cThat is one of those keywords that people keep forgetting when they talk about this issue. It\u2019s \u2018how do I get no risk?\u2019 and you can\u2019t. You have to look at what\u2019s important to the mission, versus what security is needed to then make sure it\u2019s secure and what the level is at.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd certainly when you\u2019re dealing with the entire government, there\u2019s so many different ranges of what matters and doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d she added.\n\nRenee Wynn, former chief information officer at NASA, agreed with Woytek and emphasized that it\u2019s \u201ccritical\u201d to understand the supply chain risk process before putting software onto one\u2019s network.\n\n\u201cYou have to understand what you\u2019re deploying with that and you\u2019ve got to get visibility. You aren\u2019t going for no risk. You still have risk,\u201d Wynn said. \u201cWe take risks all the time and we sometimes take blind risks.\u201d\n\nWynn compared taking a blind risk to taking a ride on a bicycle or skateboard as a kid and skinning a knee after jumping over something for the first time. While that decision has \u201ca little bit of blind risk,\u201d Wynn said it\u2019s about looking at the risk of possibly getting hurt and making a risk-based decision.\n\n\u201cWhat you want to do with supply chain risk management from a cybersecurity perspective\u2026 is take a look at [what] your risks are and then make a risk-based decision based on the data that is going to run through those systems and based on the use that you might have,\u201d she said.\n\nWynn explained that there are differences in risk-based decisions in terms of data and users. For example, she said software in a mission control center is \u201cvery different than software being used in a scientific mission because the data for scientific missions are going to flip out to the public in 24 hours.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou really do have to take a look at all of that information to make a risk-based decision and then make adjustments to your controls,\u201d Wynn said. \u201cAnd in some cases, you\u2019re going to say \u2018I\u2019m not going to use that particular product,\u2019 because you might not actually be able to put in enough controls to guarantee that you know what\u2019s going on with your data and that your monitoring tools will pick up if there\u2019s an anomalous behavior.\u201d",
    "In the third of a five-part series, Estonia-based LEAFIO AI Retail Solutions Product Director Helen Schepanyk tells how LEAFIO\u2019s customers in Ukraine are adapting to war, and the supply chain strategies they are using in order to help both their operations, and fellow citizens, survive.\n\nUkraine war has wiped out product ranges\n\nIn an environment of great volatility and uncertainty, retailers are trying to make vital product categories available in stores, and to set prices to keep them affordable, especially for vulnerable segments of the population.\n\nAnother retailer based in Kharkiv spoke to us. They are near-front line and are constantly under fire, and as a result, they are almost out of stock. At the time of speaking to them, they had just 20 dairy products in stock, there is no butter at all in the city and just one delivery of meat in four weeks, and there is practically no buckwheat in the Kharkiv region and no supplies of salt at all.\n\nDue to a shortage of flour and cereals in the region, retail chains have been forced to seek these goods in other regions - despite this being very dangerous due to mines on roads, and Russian checkpoints.\n\nIn regions gripped by hostilities - Sumy, Kharkiv, Donetsk and Luhansk - there are signs of a major food crisis and a shortage of the most necessary goods. Local production is paralysed, and delivery from other regions is extremely difficult\n\nUkraine war and the shortage of social goods\n\nWith the onset of the war more than 4 million people have fled the country, and 10 million people have been internally displaced. Many companies ceased to exist. People lost their jobs, and a huge portion of the male population went off to fight.\n\nAll these changes led to a sharp decrease in purchasing power and a shift in demand for goods in stores. Because of this, demand for premium goods decreased but demand for social goods has gone up massively.\n\nRetail in areas of Ukraine less affected by war\n\nRetail businesses in central and western Ukraine, which remain relatively secure, have hardly been affected. Stores are operating as usual - even bookstores and toy stores.\n\nDue to restrictions on emergency imports introduced by the Ukraine government, in the first weeks there was a shortage of some goods in the west. To regulate stocks of essential goods, shops and supermarkets limit the sale of basic consumer goods per customer.\n\nRegarding shortages, these are caused not only by restrictions on imports, and the loss of parts of the supply chain in regions hit by hostilities, but also due to a boycott of goods from Russian and Belarus.\n\nHow is retail helping Ukraine survive?\n\nThe war is far from over; there is little prospect of a quick settlement. The worst thing for Ukraine is that it sees the outside world beginning to get used to the fact that there is a war in Ukraine. At the beginning of the war there were daily queues of trucks with humanitarian assistance at the borders. Now there is a shortage of products in humanitarian warehouses.\n\nUkrainian retail is doing everything it can to ensure that people have something to eat.\n\nPrimarily, they are supplying our defenders, volunteers, refugees, and civilians with food and water. This is not so simple during a time of war. Retailers have no idea how many of their stores will exist tomorrow, or whether supplies will get through. But despite this heroic retailers continue to open their stores every morning.\n\nREAD MORE: Ukraine retail supply chains and war\n\nPart One - What a retail step-plan for war might look like\n\nPart Two - How the retail value chain evolved in face of bombs\n\nPart Four - Supplying children, staff and the Ukraine economy\n\nPart Five - How AI and tech will rebuild retail in peacetime",

We know that thousands of vendors serve multiple utilities. Remediating risk for one vendor will have exponential cybersecurity benefits across the entire industry.\"",
    "Welcome to a blog post series on Exiger\u2019s fight to secure supply chains, sponsored by Exiger LLC. In this series, we will explore the ongoing efforts of Exiger to lead the discussion and enhancement of Supply Chain Risk Management. In Episode 3, I visit with Skyler Chi, Director and Deputy Head of Supply Chain and Third-Party Risk Management, and Andrew Lehmann, Associate Director, and discuss supply chain issues in the IT and telecommunications sectors.\n\nWe began with an overview of risks affecting the Information and Communications Technology (ICT) industry. This includes hardware and software manufacturers and service providers. Because of this dual nature, there are dual challenges for companies operating in the ICT space. Chi noted this is \u201clargely due to their business involving so much storage of sensitive customer data and facilitating the transmission of that data worldwide. It also includes attack factors on the infrastructure they are setting up and supporting. This means that the industry has to contend with multiple types of third-party and supply chain risks.\n\nSupply chain disruption in this industry is a critical risk factor. Lehmann noted a couple of ways to help prevent such attacks, stating a \u201cstarting point is getting a handle on whether or not you have an overreliance in your supply chain concentrated in one geographic area or perhaps one country in particular. And not just that, but you might have an overreliance on a single supplier, just one company, one manufacturing facility in one country that is specialized in producing equipment to your specifications.\u201d So, you should look at \u201cwho are all of your direct suppliers, and then go a few levels deeper and learn more about their entire supply chain and find out how much of that is based in one country.\u201d He pointed to printed circuit boards, where \u201c90% of the manufacturing facilities are in Asia, primarily east Asia. More than half of those factories are in China, which gives you a lot of risks just in terms of that geographic concentration.\u201d\n\nIn addition to the direct risk modeling, you should also consider geopolitical risk. Here think of Taiwan, one of the staunchest US allies in the world. However, it is under increasing pressure from China. The Russian invasion of Ukraine has awakened many peoples\u2019 eyes to the risk of the overreliance on supply chain manufacturers from Taiwan. Can you diversify your supplier base in light of this information? It may well behoove you to do so sooner rather than later.\n\nChi noted this is \u201ca seismic shift in how our clients think about globalization globally. Previously a company would order a server rack, not caring where the parts came from. Today we are now asking the questions and establishing frameworks for us to realize that we may need to diversify ourselves away from Taiwan\u2019s semiconductor industry, for example, where 53% of global chips are manufactured.\u201d That \u201cmental shift in asking the right questions and training which we work with to ask those questions is creating real-world impacts.\u201d\n\nWe then turned to the question of to whom should this message be directed? Chi said this was an interesting question, as it got down to \u201cmanagement philosophy at core.\u201d Historically the answer would be \u201csupply chains deal with purchasing, and purchasing is done by procurement. This meant that procurement would be the risk stewards and the risk owners that have the responsibility to look into the issues.\u201d However, that type of thinking has greatly evolved and indeed, \u201coverwhelmingly what we\u2019ve seen over the last two years is that various stakeholders from across the business have really formed working groups and can consistently communicate with each other.\u201d\n\nAll of this has helped to do away with siloes. Now \u201cprocurement is working with the IT security professionals to perform vendor reviews of software bills of material for the hardware vendors that any given firm may be purchasing.\u201d There has also been an evolution of the Board\u2019s thinking about the supply chain and procurement. Chi related that it had been a \u201ccollective group effort across some of the world\u2019s largest enterprises working together. It can include the background subject matter expertise of IT, security of procurement, or even diversity and inclusivity with vendors that you might be purchasing from, which is typically seen as outside of risk management function.\u201d It is bringing \u201call stakeholders in the business, putting their budgets on the line to make those decisions.\u201d\n\nWe conclude with the role of the Board of Directors. Boards must start asking questions about their organization\u2019s supply chain risk and risk management strategy. Chi believes a key role for a Board is to \u201cset the tone at the top of any given organization, align the shareholders\u2019 values and provide the strategic vision of any given enterprise.\u201d But he cautioned that most boards\u2019 \u201clack of risk detection\u201d around the supply chain could be a limiting factor. He emphasizes that Boards should \u201cprioritize the governance framework of the firms that they oversee to the real-world risks of what that means to their organizations.\u201d\n\nJoin us tomorrow, where we will put the spotlight on the Defense Industrial Base.\n\n[View source.]",
    "On May 19, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA or the Agency) published the draft guidance \u201cRisk Management Plans to Mitigate the Potential for Drug Shortages,\u201d which aims to assist drug manufacturers in complying with the CARES Act\u2019s requirement that they have a plan to identify and evaluate risks to their supply of certain drugs. This requirement applies to establishments that manufacture a finished drug product and active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) that is covered by the statute. FDA believes that risk management plans (RMP) are a useful tool to facilitate compliance with regulatory requirements. Although FDA lacks specific authority to enforce the requirement to establish risk management plans to control the hazards associated with supply chain disruption and drug shortages, the Agency urges drug manufacturers, including application-holders that rely on contract manufacturers, to develop such risk management plans to promote a stronger, more resilient drug supply chain. FDA invites comments on the draft guidance through July 19.\n\nBackground\n\nFDA acknowledged in the press release announcing the draft guidance that disruptions in the U.S. drug supply continue to occur due to drug quality problems, vulnerabilities in the global supply chain, unanticipated increases in demand, market withdrawals of drugs, and natural disasters. In 2019, in an effort to address the national drug shortage, the federal Drug Shortages Task Force released a report that called for the adoption of risk management plans to proactively assess risk and to predict and prevent supply disruptions that could potentially lead to a drug shortage. Then in 2020, Congress passed the CARES Act to require certain manufacturers to develop, maintain, and implement, as appropriate, a \u201credundancy risk management plan\u201d that identify and evaluate risks to a drug\u2019s supply. The draft guidance drops the word \u201credundancy\u201d from the required risk management plan, and acknowledges that redundancy (e.g., more than one supplier) is an example of a risk control strategy but is not the only possible way to control supply risks.\n\nThe statutory requirement for each manufacturer of a covered drug, to develop, maintain and implement a supply risk management plan for such covered drugs (including APIs) went into effect in September of 2020. In addition, the statute expressly grants FDA the authority to inspect, copy, or request such risk management plans either during an inspection or as part of an information request in lieu of, or in support of, an inspection. However, Congress failed to grant FDA any mechanisms to enforce the new requirements for supply risk management plans. The failure to develop, maintain or implement such a risk management plan is not linked to any Prohibited Act under 21 USC 331 or otherwise connected to any consequence, penalty, or other enforcement provision. In contrast, Congress created a noncompliance letter mechanism for failure to submit required information regarding the discontinuance or interruption in the production of lifesaving drugs. See 21 USC 356c(f). Nevertheless, drug manufacturers should not be surprised if FDA starts requesting supply risk management plans during on-site inspections and through information requests. It is also possible that, in the future, Congress will further expand FDA\u2019s enforcement authority with regard to this requirement.\n\nThe draft guidance also expansively interprets the statutory requirement for supply risk management plans by interpreting the term \u201cmanufacturer\u201d to extend to an application-holder, as a \u201cprimary stakeholder,\u201d even if the application holder relies on contract manufactures for the actual manufacturing. Although this interpretation goes beyond a literal interpretation of the statute, it is aligned with FDA\u2019s 2015 implementing regulations for 21 USC 356c, which apply to application holders \u201cthe responsibility for reporting to FDA a permanent discontinuance or an interruption in manufacturing, whether the product is manufactured by the applicant itself or for the applicant under contract with one or more different entities.\u201d 80 FR 38915, 38917 (Jul. 8, 2015).\n\nWho should implement a risk management plan?\n\nThe draft guidance defines stakeholders in the manufacturing supply chain for drugs and describes the products for which RMPs would be required. FDA points out that these stakeholders include both primary stakeholders, which are entities that determine which materials and services are necessary to produce a drug product; and secondary stakeholders, who have more detailed insight into specific segments of the supply chain for a drug product but may not have an understanding of its entirety. These stakeholders include NDA/BLA/ANDA holders, both finished product and API manufacturers, and other parties as well, such as inactive ingredient manufacturers, packagers, and distributors. According to the Agency, these primary and secondary stakeholders are among those that are subject to the risk management plan requirements. However, FDA recommends that all stakeholders consider developing, maintaining and implementing risk management plans, even for products for which such RMPs are not required by statute.\n\nThe types of drugs for which RMPs are required by statute include:\n\nLife-sustaining and life-supporting drugs, including APIs\n\nDrugs, including APIs, to prevent or treat a debilitating disease or condition, including for emergency medical care or surgery or is critical to the public health during a public health emergency\n\nAny associated medical device used for the preparation or administration of these drugs\n\nThe draft guidance also spotlights seven other types of other drugs for which RMPs are recommended:\n\nDrugs to treat rare diseases\n\nDrugs that lack appropriate alternatives\n\nMedical countermeasures used in the event of a potential public health emergency stemming from a terrorist attack\n\nSole source drugs\n\nDrugs with only one API manufacturer in the product\u2019s supply chain that has been appropriately qualified by the quality unit of the finished dosage form (FDF) establishment\n\nDrugs with only one FDF manufacturer in the product\u2019s supply chain\n\nDrugs manufactured in a facility with an inspection in the last 5 years that was classified as official action indicated (OAI)\n\nWhat should a risk management plan include?\n\nFDA recommends using the quality risk management process and principles described in ICH Q9 as the framework to develop an effective RMP. The RMP should consist of three elements: a risk assessment, risk control and risk review. The draft guidance adds to the elements of that framework, describes considerations for stakeholder oversight for RMPs, and aims to assist with the interpretation of the quality risk management process within the context of developing RMPs.\n\nThe draft guidance states that RMPs should result in understanding the risk of supply disruptions that may lead to shortages across the supply chain, integrates redundancy into the supply chain, improves the forecasting of demand changes at all stages of production, maintains sustainable compliance, improves overall incentives between purchasers and manufacturers, and fosters collaboration with regulators. In addition, FDA recommends that the primary stakeholder RMPs should also include plans to repair the supply chain after a disruption.\n\nFDA also recommends that the primary stakeholder share as much of its RMP as possible with secondary and other stakeholders of the drug product to enable secondary and other stakeholders to incorporate the broad strategies of the primary stakeholder\u2019s RMP into their own plans and contextualize the risks identified in the primary stakeholder\u2019s RMP, specifically for the manufacturing facility.\n\nAn appendix to the draft guidance provides helpful risk factors that should be considered when developing specific RMPs to mitigate the potential for drug shortages. A few notable risk factors, applicable to different stakeholders, include:\n\nweaknesses in the manufacturing process specific to individual drugs or in inventory management at the manufacturing facility\n\nwhether the drug manufacturing relies on incapable or unreliable equipment\n\nwhether any of the suppliers of drug product container-closure systems or device constituent parts\n\ngeographic risk factors, including potential for natural disasters, political instability and regulatory uncertainty\n\nmanufacturing vulnerabilities, including lack of manufacturing capacity to meet an unexpected surge in demand, inadequate backup manufacturing capability, lack of availability of contract manufacturers or other alternate sources, lack of availability of laboratory services to support manufacturing, and inadequacy of management oversight\n\npotential vulnerability to cyber threats\n\ncapability and historical record of the facilities in the supply chain, including whether there is a history of sustained current good manufacturing practice (CGMP) compliance, including the presence or recurrence of quality issues, CGMP violations, potential for major defects and recalls, inspectional findings at the facilities in the supply chain, and adequacy of quality management oversight, that might affect the availability of the drug\n\nweaknesses in the infrastructure and utilities; water systems; heating, ventilation, air conditioning, and environmental control; and the proximity of support services such as laboratory testing\n\nComments on the draft guidance are due July 19, 2022.",
    "Acumen Research and Consulting\n\nAcumen Research and Consulting recently published report titled \u201cVendor Risk Management Market Size, Share, Analysis Report and Region Forecast, 2022 - 2030\u201d\n\nTOKYO, June 23, 2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The Global Vendor Risk Management Market size accounted for USD 5,712 Mn in 2021 and is expected to reach USD 18,820 Mn by 2030 with a considerable CAGR of 14.5% during the forecast timeframe of 2022 to 2030.\n\n\n\nOver the years, businesses have begun to outsource important functions to vendors, which can provide both advantages and drawbacks. The COVID-19 outbreak, the cyber-attack, and subsequent ransom breaches have all widened the spectrum of supplier threats. As a result, businesses are increasingly relying on comprehensive vendor risk management software to discover access, analyze, and mitigate security concerns. As a result, the global vendor risk management industry is expected to expand substantially over the prediction period. Rising demand for managing the complicated third-party distribution system, rapidly changing legislative proposals in various countries, and the requirement to properly evaluate and control vendor performance at all stages of the supply chain are driving the vendor risk management market. Furthermore, the most significant impediment to market expansion is many organizations' reliance on a non-formal and unorganized method for analyzing vendor risks.\n\nVendor risk management (VRM) refers to the concept of ensuring that the use of service providers and vendors does not pose an unacceptable risk of business disruption or have a negative influence on firm performance. VRM is the monitoring of business associates, intermediaries, or third-party vendors both during and prior to the period of a commercial arrangement. It is a critical component and approaches to employ during the supply chain selection and contract management processes. This system assists enterprises by improving the effectiveness of business solutions, increasing financial or operational efficiencies, cutting total costs, ensuring the availability of expert services, and a variety of other functions.\n\nStory continues\n\nRequest for a free sample report @\n\nhttps://www.acumenresearchandconsulting.com/request-sample/2964\n\nReport Coverage:\n\nMarket Vendor Risk Management Market Market Size 2021 US$ 5,712 Mn Market Forecast 2030 US$ 18,820 Mn CAGR 14.5% During 2022 - 2030 Analysis Period 2018 - 2030 Base Year 2021 Forecast Data 2022 - 2030 Segments Covered By Component, By Deployment, By Organization Size, By Vertical, And By Geography\n\nRegional Scope North America, Europe, Asia Pacific, Latin America, and Middle East & Africa Key Companies Profiled Bit Sight Technologies, Logic Manager, Inc., Resolver, Inc., Metric Stream, IBM Corporation, Optive Security, Inc., LockPath, Genpact Limited, RSA Security LLC, SAI Global, LexisNexis Group, Inc., and Rapid Ratings International, Inc.

Vendor risk management helps businesses identify and mitigate potential risks of vendors. It is a systematic activity carried out by organizations with each vendor who joins the supply chain operations. VRM protects businesses from threats such as financial impact, operational impact, and legal and cultural loss. Organizations are deploying VRM systems to reduce expenses, remove waste, and avoid breaches through better risk intelligence. In a pandemic situation, the implementation of vendor risk management is emerging because it supports enterprises in identifying critical suppliers so that organizations may readily replace or reinstate dual suppliers to decrease the possibility of failure. However, the endurance of the COVID-19 tragedy will compel organizations to deploy vendor risk management systems in order to reduce the work required to discover essential aspects of vendor performance and critical difficulties when acquiring goods and services from 3rd-party vendors.\n\nCheck the detailed table of contents of the report @\n\nhttps://www.acumenresearchandconsulting.com/table-of-content/vendor-risk-management-market\n\nSmall and Medium-sized Enterprises are Likely to Grow at a Faster Rate During the Forecast Period\n\nThe SMEs segment is expected to grow at a quicker rate during the projection period. SMEs usually aim to create relationships with multiple providers to accomplish their business objectives because they lack an in-house pool of resources. With the increasing need to work with suppliers from diverse geographies, it is vital for small and medium-sized businesses to ensure and reduce the critical risks associated with their vendors. In discovering opportunities in SMEs, cloud-based vendor risk management tools have proved critical. Besides that, Cloud-based vendor risk management solutions are becoming popular among small and medium-sized businesses because they enable SMEs to efficiently and decisively assess and understand both prospective and current vendors, from initial on boarding through ongoing due diligence and monitoring.\n\nVendor Risk Management Market Regional Overview\n\nNorth America, Europe, Asia-Pacific, Latin America, and the Middle East & Africa are the regional classification of the global vendor risk management market. Over the projection period, Asia-Pacific is anticipated to witness the fastest region. The market is expected to be driven by the rapid rise in consumer discretionary income and the expanding number of Small and medium enterprises in India, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan. Asia-Pacific is likely to be a profitable investment for vendor risk management throughout the forecast period, owing to the region's untapped prospects and increased commercial expenditure in many industrial verticals. Global corporations have prioritized investigating the Asia-Pacific market through joint ventures with local enterprises, sales representatives, and joint venture partners. During the projection period, this is projected to generate growth prospects for vendor risk management vendors.\n\nVendor Risk Management Market Segmentation\n\nThe global vendor risk management market has been segmented by Acumen Research and Consulting based on component, deployment, enterprise size, and vertical.

    "In effect, the industry\u2019s transformation is colliding with traditional loss exposures and new ones.\n\nThe increase in risks for midsized manufacturers is especially challenging, as there may not be a clearly defined management role to address the current complexities. Depending on a company\u2019s size and budget, some midsize manufacturers employ professional risk managers to assess their loss exposures and transfer related risks to insurers and reinsurers, while others rely on the CFO or other functional leaders to make these decisions.\n\nWhile the property and casualty insurance industry offers resources to help manufacturers address these issues, an eye-opening 75 percent of mid-sized manufacturing executives whose role includes risk management say their needs \u201care not being met,\u201d up from 62 percent the prior year, according to QBE\u2019s second annual Mid-Sized Company Risk Report survey.\n\n75 percent of mid-sized manufacturing executives whose role includes risk management say their needs \u2018are not being met.\u2019\n\nThe onus is on the insurance industry to better understand the intricate problems confronting manufacturers and why these challenges are adversely affecting the opinions of executives with risk management responsibilities. In the survey, two key issues were raised\u2014an absence in risk management advice customized to the unique circumstances of each manufacturer and a lack of holistic risk solutions.\n\nThis shortcoming often appears in our dealings with prospective customers \u2013 especially since the onset of COVID-19. We have seen a rise in the frequency of brokers coming to us with clients looking for a new insurance carrier due to last-minute changes in terms and conditions by the incumbent carrier. Often the complaint is that the current insurer made an insufficient effort to understand the client\u2019s unique risk profile.\n\nOther mid-sized manufacturing executives cited growing apprehension over regulatory compliance and business interruption risks. State regulations put forth in 2020, for example, require employers to document measures protecting workers exposed to COVID-19. Failure to comply with the rules can result in prohibitively costly OSHA violations, not to mention a potential uptick in workers compensation claims volume and a lengthy business disruption (the greater the number of workers sidelined by the coronavirus, the greater the possibility of a business disruption).\n\nMid-sized manufacturers also are coping with higher insurance costs. The steep rise in more frequent catastrophic storms, evident most recently by the 34 tornadoes that caused an estimated $18 billion in damages in eight states in December 2021, has resulted in sharply higher commercial property insurance premiums.\n\nRelated content: How Manufacturing Has Adapted to the Pandemic\n\nManufacturers are under duress from fragile supply chains, resulting in higher costs for materials and components, and pronounced labor shortages caused by the so-called Great Resignation. With the Producer Price Index up 11% on an unadjusted basis for the 12 months ended April 2022, the need for accurate property and equipment replacement cost valuations for insurance purpose has risen in complexity and importance. A protracted business disruption on top of these many issues can be an existential threat.\n\nCertainly, managing risk in the sector is not for the fainthearted. Help is sorely needed, as the survey findings suggest.\n\nHelp is On the Way\n\nTo better grasp their loss exposures during this period of complex economic, technological and meteorological change, mid-sized manufacturers need to work more closely with their brokers to find an insurance company that specializes in serving their sector. The optimal insurer should be a carrier that sees its relationship with the insured as a trusted partnership, in which both parties can benefit from improved risk identification, pragmatic loss prevention tactics, and more targeted and efficient post-loss services.\n\nFor example, a trusted partnership can assist risk managers struggling with the industry\u2019s revolving door of labor\u2014a key factor in higher workplace injuries and illnesses. In November 2021, manufacturing employment fell by nearly 400,000 workers from pre-pandemic levels, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The precipitous decline in labor made it difficult for companies to process and unload imports of commodities and components, contributing to the historic shipment delays affecting the global supply chain.\n\nTo make up for the talent shortfall, new employees must be hired and trained. Statistics have long shown that new workers are more susceptible to workplace injuries. In some studies, employees in their first month on the job are more than three times as likely to incur a lost-time work-related injury as workers with more than one year tenure. In such cases, insurers can bring to bear a wealth of experience designing safe and efficient training programs.\n\nThe insurance industry has long provided a broad array of risk transfer solutions to the manufacturing sector, but there is need to assist mid-sized manufacturers with more holistic risk management.\n\nAn insurer that specializes in serving mid-sized manufacturers will have assembled a vast library of online training videos tailored to different job processes and customized to risk manager needs and concerns. Some specialized insurers also may provide value-added services like AI-powered software to assess each job task from a musculoskeletal disorder (MSD) risk standpoint. An example is the Humantech industrial ergonomics software, in which a mobile phone video is taken of a worker performing a specific job task.\n\nOnce the video is uploaded, the software recognizes body segments and records the frequency and duration of different movements, as well as the angles of different joints, stress points and postures, to discern potential MSD injury risks. Once identified, the insurer partners with the customer to design safer job task positions and train workers in these proper movements.\n\nSome specialized insurers can help compensate for the production slowdowns caused by supply chain stoppages. When complex manufacturing equipment is damaged, it has become increasingly difficult over the past two years to find replacement parts on a timely basis. Large insurers often have a global procurement network they can leverage on behalf of midsized manufacturers to source parts on an expedited basis.\n\nTo improve the company\u2019s commercial insurance claims outcomes, specialized insurers can provide access to the carrier\u2019s easy-to-use AI-driven data and analytics tools. Using machine learning algorithms to analyze a database of workers compensation claims, for example, insights are captured to reduce the frequency and severity of these costly claims, returning injured or ill workers back to work on a faster timetable.\n\nRelated content: QBE North America: Assessing and Managing Risk\n\nThe insurance industry has long provided a broad array of risk transfer solutions to the manufacturing sector, but as the survey findings suggest, there is need to assist mid-sized manufacturers with more holistic risk management. To meet this need, insurers must be proactive. For example, we reached out to our customer in the paper manufacturing industry who felt the incumbent carrier did not understand its risk profile.\n\nAn evaluation by our Risk Solutions team, which conducted in-person inspections of the company\u2019s two manufacturing sites, suggested that its high-risk profile was due to two issues\u2014a large volume of dust and problems with storing flammable products. The team advised more frequent cleaning to overcome the first problem and the addition of an automatic fire door to address the second problem. The changes were made by the company, culminating in a property insurance policy aligned with its risk profile.\n\nAs the relationship burgeoned, we provided quotes for their other lines of insurance and took on these risks, as well, simplifying its insurance program from two carriers to one. Our claims relationship management team now serves as a single point of contact for risk management across the customer\u2019s property, general liability, commercial automobile, workers compensation and umbrella liability policies.\n\nThat\u2019s the value of a trusted relationship. At a time of such complicated loss exposures for mid-sized manufacturers, the insurance industry needs to reimagine the nature of the services we provide. With so much data at our disposal, we have an opportunity to do more than simply bear client risks. As the survey made plainly clear, our expertise and guidance are needed, too.",
    "Tell us a little about yourself and Overhaul\n\nI am a manufacturing engineer and a chartered engineer from Belfast, Northern Ireland, and have spent my entire career in supply chain.\n\nI joined Andersen Consulting (Accenture) as a Process Consultant working across multiple industries in supply chain design and creation before joining Microsoft in 1999. I spent 23 years at Microsoft, working in multiple areas - operations, manufacturing, strategic sourcing, fulfillment and logistics, and channel management.\n\nI was involved in the release of every product from Windows 2000 to the latest Surface device. I have had the pleasure of leading and building teams all over the world, building distribution centers and manufacturing plants, and managing large-scale acquisitions, such as Nokia.\n\nI spent my last years at Microsoft running the global supply chain and working as the company\u2019s Supply Chain Technology Officer, looking forward within the industry for the next generation of technological opportunities for supply chain.\n\nI retired from Microsoft in March this year to further embrace the opportunity that technology can bridge the digital and physical supply chains and disrupt the traditional way of thinking. As part of that transition, I joined Overhaul, a Texas-based company at the leading edge of supply chain visibility, integrity and security.\n\nMy role as EVP of Enterprise is to not only help with growing the business but also think about how it connects to the greater ecosystem and the boundless opportunities that we collectively have to change the supply chain for the better. I am a member of the Visibility Council, an industry body that\u2019s reshaping supply chain thinking as well as working with numerous other early-stage companies as an advisor to support the continual evolution.\n\nWhat supply chain lessons do you take from Microsoft?\n\nI think the biggest lesson I took away is the art of the possible. Just because something has always been achieved in a certain way does not mean it is either the right way or the only way. When the general opinion is that something can not be done \u2013 that is the exact time for creativity to bloom, as embracing change and being willing to take a risk is the true path to evolution.\n\nFrom a pure supply chain perspective, it goes without saying that people are the greatest asset. Finding the right opportunity to embrace creativity, fail fast and continually innovate and bring those around you on the journey creates momentum, which in itself is an accelerant to change.\n\nHow do haulage challenges vary across North America, Europe & Asia?\n\nThe three regions are very different in terms of the logistics infrastructure, the participants and the overall network capabilities. Europe and Asia tend to have more specificity in terms of carriers by sub-region, and that can limit the ability to leverage global contracts and service levels. In general, however, similar problems exist - the ability to have clear end-to-end visibility of cargo, the need to understand how to keep that cargo safe and secure, driver shortages, fuel and insurance costs, and a constant stream of disruptions never seen before in the industry.\n\nHow are you helping resolve these issues?\n\nNo one solution can solve all problems. At Overhaul, we focus on the areas where we have built industry-leading expertise: the ability to have full visibility across your logistics network, and the ability to understand a disruption or event in real time so that we can provide actionable insights or even manage the disruption on behalf of the customer.\n\nThe great enabler here is technology, connecting to devices and existing telemetry available in the transportation network and making that visible and accessible in order to effect change in real-time, instead of waiting to report an event that has already taken place.\n\nBuilding creative solutions that pull predictive insights based on the vast amount of data available and building resilience by leveraging IoT capabilities and multiple connectors help Overhaul support our customers in this volatile landscape. We can\u2019t impact fuel prices, but we can help optimize based on data. We are bringing new offerings to market that will help with insurance costs and increase driver safety. At Overhaul, we are from the industry, intent on supporting the industry at a time when everyone needs it most.\n\n",
    "From delayed home improvement projects to the sudden scarcity of baby formula, supply chain shortages caused or exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic have become a common answer to why we currently cannot have something right away and at a sensible price. However, the baby formula shortage is just the most recent crisis that has exposed the systemic failures in American life-critical product supply chains, said Jacqueline Griffin and \u00d6zlem Ergun, Northeastern industrial engineers and researchers of supply chains resiliency.\n\nLeft to right: Jacqueline Griffin assistant professor of mechanical and industrial engineering and \u00d6zlem Ergun, professor of mechanical and industrial engineering. Photo by Matthew Modoono/Northeastern University and courtesy photo\n\n\u201cCOVID was the disruption. The underlying problem is that we are working in a broken system that, in many cases, has very little information transparency and makes it very difficult to operate,\u201d Griffin said. \u201cWe need to move from a perspective of thinking [that] this is COVID driven. Let\u2019s get through this point, and instead start to think about broad systematic policy-level changes.\u201d\n\nThe baby formula shortage has all the same key system features as the chronic drug supply shortages at the U.S. hospitals\u2014a topic Griffin and Ergun have been researching for the last eight years. Both have a life-critical product at the center; a limited number of manufacturers and manufacturing sites; manufacturing quality concerns; and, most importantly, limited information sharing between supply chain stakeholders.\n\nAnd one cannot blame hospital drug shortages on the COVID-19 pandemic\u2014they have been going on for decades, Griffin said.\n\n\u201cWhen we talk to MGH [Massachusetts General Hospital] every week, there is a list of [scarce] products they talk to us about. It is not just one or two,\u201d said Ergun, who is a member of a committee at the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine that is tasked with examining the security and resilience of the U.S. medical product supply chain.\n\n\u201cGiven that it is a public health good, it is surprising how there is no awareness about it in the public,\u201d Ergun said.\n\nThere are currently more than 100 drugs in short supply on the U.S. Food and Drug Administration\u2019s list. Recent drug shortages that have garnered attention include a sterile saline solution shortage in 2017 and 2018 after Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico, where most of it was manufactured; and a heparin shortage in 2019 due to African swine fever killing pigs in China.\n\nBoth medicines are critical in the treatment of many patients. The sterile saline solution shortage put a months-long hold on many surgeries across the U.S., Griffin said. The shortage of heparin\u2014which is derived from pigs and slows down blood clotting during open-heart surgery or blood transfusions\u2014 forced hospitals like MGH to substantially curb its use.\n\n\u201cI am impressed by the people that are on the frontlines trying to manage this,\u201d Griffin said. \u201cThey truly go to extraordinary measures. And that is why there is not a broader discussion of it, because they do so much, but the system that they are working in is broken.\u201d\n\nGriffin said that the time hospitals will be able to continue managing drug shortages on their own is limited.\n\nErgun described drug supply chains as very disorganized environments, the disruption of which can lead to many different consequences that are mostly unseen by patients. They drive hospital costs up as more staff is required to manage a shortage and purchasing substitutes might be more expensive.\n\n\u201cAnd who really bears the burden of the cost? Is it the hospital, is it the insurance company, is it the patient?\u201d Griffin said.\n\nWhile hospitals scramble for substitute drugs, look for alternative producers, and try to compound supplies internally, further artificial shortages arise due to hoarding.\n\nSome patients might also experience some negative effects after receiving a substitute, Griffin said.\n\nTo make supply chains more resilient, able to withstand disruptions and avoid public harm, the government needs to implement broad reforms, including enacting policies that regulate radical information sharing within the supply chain, Ergun and Griffin said.\n\nA major problem is that nobody knows just how risky various supply chains are in terms of shortage probability, even for a Band-Aid, Ergun said, because the chains are very complex and involve several steps in multiple countries. For the last several decades, the focus was not on the risk but rather on costs.\n\n\u201cAs a world, we have really focused on cost-savings on every single item,\u201d Ergun said. \u201cThis led to supply chain policies that are cost-effective, just-in-time, with very little inventory kept at each step, and always going for the supplier or the producer with the lowest cost.\u201d\n\nResiliency, however, comes at additional cost, though there isn\u2019t a need to make all supply chains resilient all the time.\n\n\u201cFirst we have to understand risk, then we have to understand critical products, and then decide on the right level of resiliency we should build in a supply chain,\u201d Ergun said.\n\nShe and Griffin argue that drug supply shortages should be approached by examining supply redundancies, correlated risks among manufacturers, historical quality records, and lack of available alternatives. With that information, the government can focus on enacting policies and regulations that ensure that the incentives for private manufacturers and public health and safety priorities are aligned.\n\nThere should also be warning systems put in place that measure and characterize the health of a supply system. Manufacturers should be required to do their own risk assessment and share information regarding their supply chain with at least one public agency.\n\n\u201cIt is time to learn our lesson and start moving towards really having more information so that we can better understand what the current state of our resiliency is. And then start to look at what solutions are needed for different pharmaceutical products, and not try to just focus on broad stroke solutions,\u201d Griffin said.\n\nFor media inquiries, please contact media@northeastern.edu.",
    "JUST IN: Army to Release Supply Chain Risk Management Directive\n\n\n\nBy Yasmin Tadjdeh\n\nArmy photo\n\nNORFOLK, Va. \u2014 Governments across the globe have been shook by ongoing supply chain issues and now the Army is preparing to release a directive aimed at managing shortfalls of critical goods and materials, an official said March 1.\n\n\u201cSupply chain risk management is an all-of-government approach,\u201d said Timothy Goddette, deputy assistant secretary of the Army for acquisition, logistics and technology at the office of the assistant secretary of the Army for sustainment.\n\nHis office plans to work alongside organizations such as the Defense Acquisition University to craft the directive and release courses aimed at supply chain risk, he said during remarks at the National Defense Industrial Association\u2019s annual Tactical Wheeled Vehicles Conference.\n\nThe Army plans to launch pilot programs with five program executive offices to inform the directive, he said.\n\n\"Then we can continue to evolve policy,\u201d he said. \u201cThe worst thing we could do is write a policy that \u2026 drives everybody into one solution without getting feedback from the field.\u201d\n\nWhile supply chain risk management is nothing new for industry, more collaboration between companies and the government could bear fruit, he said.\n\n\u201cMaybe now [with] the government and industry working together \u2026 [we can] look at things a little bit differently\u201d and adjust procedures, he said.\n\nSome notable supply chain challenges have included batteries, microelectronics, chemicals and raw materials as production of some goods move offshore, Goddette said.\n\nHowever, \u201cthe Army, and the DoD for that matter, does not necessarily control some of those commodities \u2014 we're not the driver,\u201d he said.\n\nOftentimes when the government puts its contracts together it evaluates bids based on several factors, \u201cbut the question is, do we ever evaluate the risk associated with the supply chain?\u201d Goddette asked.\n\n\u201cIf we don't, maybe we've been tacit in our ability to say, \u2018Alright, we're just going to leave it up to you and the government really doesn't have a role in helping finance the rest of the supply chain,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cI think that's going to be the biggest change in our policy. \u2026 The government does have a role.\u201d\n\nThe Defense Department has mechanisms that can help mitigate some risk, and agencies may not be utilizing all of them, he said.\n\n\u201cWhen we talk about raw materials, or parts or components, the Defense Production Act broken into Title One, Three and Seven, already has mechanisms in place that address priorities, they address capacity, and/or health of the industrial base,\u201d he said.\n\nThat means there is some money available to help address some issues, Goddette said.\n\nTitle I address priorities and allocations authority for industrial resources; Title III addresses domestic production essential for national defense; and Title VII reviews transactions that could result in foreign control.\n\n\u201cThe Department of Defense and you as our industry partners have tools ... that will help you in the supply chain in some circumstances,\u201d he said.\n\nTitle III allows the Pentagon to invest in domestic sources to expand, maintain and monitor needed equipment, he said.\n\n\u201cIf we know you're having an issue some place and especially if it's impacting more than one industry partner, we can get that together and make our request up to [the office of the secretary of defense to] get that kind of money,\u201d he said.\n\nMost of the funding so far has gone toward soldier systems and aviation platforms, but that doesn\u2019t mean that the Defense Department can\u2019t invest in other areas, he said.\n\n\u201cCongress is willing to work with us, but we need your feedback on the areas that you're having \u2026 [issues with] and then we can work that together,\u201d Goddette said.\n\nTopics: Tactical Wheeled Vehicles",
    "The global supply chain places companies and consumers at cybersecurity risk because of the many sources of components and software that often compose a finished product: A device may have been designed in one country and built in another using multiple components manufactured in various parts of the world. Credit: B. Hayes/NIST\n\nA vulnerable spot in global commerce is the supply chain: It enables technology developers and vendors to create and deliver innovative products but can leave businesses, their finished wares, and ultimately their consumers open to cyberattacks. A new update to the National Institute of Standards and Technology\u2019s (NIST\u2019s) foundational cybersecurity supply chain risk management (C-SCRM) guidance aims to help organizations protect themselves as they acquire and use technology products and services.\n\nThe revised publication, formally titled Cybersecurity Supply Chain Risk Management Practices for Systems and Organizations (NIST Special Publication 800-161 Revision 1), provides guidance on identifying, assessing and responding to cybersecurity risks throughout the supply chain at all levels of an organization. It forms part of NIST\u2019s response to Executive Order 14028: Improving the Nation\u2019s Cybersecurity, specifically Sections 4(c) and (d), which concern enhancing the security of the software supply chain.\n\nReleased today after a multiyear development process that included two draft versions, the publication now offers key practices for organizations to adopt as they develop their capability to manage cybersecurity risks within and across their supply chains. It encourages organizations to consider the vulnerabilities not only of a finished product they are considering using, but also of its components \u2014 which may have been developed elsewhere \u2014 and the journey those components took to reach their destination.\n\n\u201cManaging the cybersecurity of the supply chain is a need that is here to stay,\u201d said NIST\u2019s Jon Boyens, one of the publication\u2019s authors. \u201cIf your agency or organization hasn\u2019t started on it, this is a comprehensive tool that can take you from crawl to walk to run, and it can help you do so immediately.\u201d\n\nModern products and services depend on their supply chains, which connect a worldwide network of manufacturers, software developers and other service providers. Though they enable the global economy, supply chains also place companies and consumers at risk because of the many sources of components and software that often compose a finished product: A device may have been designed in one country and built in another using multiple components from various parts of the world that have themselves been assembled of parts from disparate manufacturers. Not only might the resulting product contain malicious software or be susceptible to cyberattack, but the vulnerability of the supply chain itself can affect a company\u2019s bottom line.\n\n\u201cA manufacturer might experience a supply disruption for critical manufacturing components due to a ransomware attack at one of its suppliers, or a retail chain might experience a data breach because the company that maintains its air conditioning systems has access to the store\u2019s data sharing portal,\u201d Boyens said.\n\nThe primary audience for the revised publication is acquirers and end users of products, software and services. The guidance helps organizations build cybersecurity supply chain risk considerations and requirements into their acquisition processes and highlights the importance of monitoring for risks. Because cybersecurity risks can arise at any point in the life cycle or any link in the supply chain, the guidance now considers potential vulnerabilities such as the sources of code within a product, for example, or retailers that carry it.\n\n\u201cIf your agency or organization hasn\u2019t started on [C-SCRM], this is a comprehensive tool that can take you from crawl to walk to run, and it can help you do so immediately.\u201d \u2014NIST's Jon Boyens\n\n\u201cIt has to do with trust and confidence,\u201d said NIST\u2019s Angela Smith, an information security specialist and another of the publication\u2019s authors. \u201cOrganizations need to have greater assurance that what they are purchasing and using is trustworthy. This new guidance can help you understand what risks to look for and what actions to consider taking in response.\u201d\n\nBefore providing specific guidance \u2014 called cybersecurity controls, which are listed in Appendix A \u2014 the publication offers help to the varied groups in its intended audience, which ranges from cybersecurity specialists and risk managers to systems engineers and procurement officials. Each group is offered a \u201cuser profile\u201d in Section 1.4, which advises what parts of the publication are most relevant to the group.\n\nThe publication\u2019s Sections 1.6 and 1.7 specify how it integrates guidance promoted within other NIST publications and tailors that guidance for C-SCRM. These other publications include NIST\u2019s Cybersecurity Framework and Risk Management Framework, as well as Security and Privacy Controls for Information Systems and Organizations, or SP 800-53 Rev. 5, its flagship catalog of information system safeguards. Organizations that are already using SP 800-53 Rev. 5\u2019s safeguards may find useful perspective in Appendix B, which details how SP 800-161 Rev. 1\u2019s cybersecurity controls map onto them.\n\nOrganizations seeking to implement C-SCRM in accordance with Executive Order 14028 should visit NIST's dedicated web-based portal, as Appendix F now indicates. This information has been moved online, in part to reflect evolving guidance without directly affecting the published version of SP 800-161 Rev. 1.\n\nIn part because of the complexity of the subject, the authors are planning a quick-start guide to help readers who may be just beginning their organization\u2019s C-SCRM effort. Boyens said they also plan to offer the main publication as a user-friendly webpage.\n\n\u201cWe plan to augment the document\u2019s current PDF format with a clickable web version,\u201d he said. \u201cDepending on what group of users you fall into, it will allow you to click on a link and find the sections you need.\u201d\n\nThe publication is available on the NIST website.",
    "Manufacturers across a variety of sectors are being urged to consider fattening their inventories as quickly as possible in order to mitigate a prolonged disruption to global supply chains. The advice comes from supply chain risk and performance management specialist, Achilles, whose latest report on the resilience of global supply chains indicates high risks are evident across almost all sectors and geographies.\n\nThe Q2 Achilles Supply Chain Resilience Index (ASCRI) now indicates a score of 39.8 \u2013 the first time the figure has fallen below its 40-point high-risk threshold, with further declines in resilience expected.\n\nAnticipation of a protracted war in Ukraine and the re-emergence of COVID in China bringing about further logistical challenges have led to a desperate need for procurement professionals to mitigate the potential impact of supply losses over the months to come.\n\nWhere possible, bringing the next order forward can help manufacturers to potentially afford themselves one extra stock cycle and the time to find alternatives if supply is lost.\n\nWhile many will be concerned about the cost of an extra stock cycle in the short term, the cost premium is still expected to be less than that caused by large-scale stockouts.\n\n\u201cProcurement professionals work tirelessly to plan contingencies should supply chain disruption arise, but what happens when there are so many risks that some become unavoidable? With the prolonged conflict in Ukraine and extremely tight restrictions on movement in China at present, the prospect of further disruption and even higher costs seem almost inevitable,\u201d commented Katie Tamblin, Chief Product Officer at Achilles.\n\n\u201cIt would be wise for manufacturers to consider acting now to mitigate even greater risks months down the line. By bringing planned orders forward as much as possible, that extra stock cycle and the extra planning time it brings, could prove to be an invaluable way to find alternative sources of supply.\u201d\n\nThe ASCRI is a time series index measuring changes in supply chain risk. The index measures underlying supply chain risk by country across six categories: Economic, Environmental, Labour Practices, Legal and Governance, Resilience, and Safety and Security. Each country\u2019s score is derived by combining the Achilles\u2019 Scores of suppliers based in the country with that country\u2019s overall performance in those six categories. This framework is then supplemented by a range of global measures, including shipping and sentiment data. The Q2 Report uses data from January to March 2022.\n\nManufacturing & Engineering Magazine | The Home of Manufacturing Industry News",

    "The pandemic highlighted how fragile the global manufacturing network is, as supply of certain products was limited and regulatory inspections became difficult to carry out. Ben Hargreaves finds out how the issue of foreign manufacturing has become a major US political talking point and how this could influence the pressures facing the industry.\n\nIn a global economy, across a number of industries, low-margin products are often manufactured in countries where labour is cheap. The pharmaceutical industry is no different, with India and China becoming two of the leading manufacturers and exporters of generic medicine, as well as medical supplies, antibiotics and ingredients required to manufacture treatments.\n\nAccording to research, the US is reliant on overseas production for two-thirds of its demand for generic medicine and 90% of generic active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) facilities are not located within the US. This puts the US in a position where it is almost entirely dependent on other countries for access to certain treatments. In particular, China is the second largest exporter of drugs and biologics to the US and the largest for medical devices. In recent years, this has become a major talking point within US politics.\n\nSecurity of supply\n\nThe reason the US government is worried about the supply of pharmaceuticals is immediately clear, a problem securing access to antibiotics, for example, would be a major public health issue. According to data from a report by the American Action Forum, the US is not overly dependent on one country for its broader supply of antibiotics, with Canada, India, Italy and China supplying the bulk of demand. However, for individual antibiotics, China is the main source of the ingredients for penicillin and cephalosporin, which represent approximately two-thirds of the antibiotics used in the US each day.\n\nThis is enough to cause concern within the US government, leading it to recently pass a bill through the Senate with aims to boost the US manufacturing sector and to diversify the supply chain, specifically in regard to a perceived overdependence on China. The government\u2019s stance reflects a wider mood within the US population, as a poll conducted by Americans for Safe Drugs suggested that 85% of respondents deemed US government policies to encourage domestic production of generic products as being \u2018somewhat\u2019 or \u2018very important\u2019.\n\nThe pandemic effect\n\nThe growing importance of the question over supply will likely grow, as the pandemic has raised fears over the supply of medicine. The worries over potential supply issues were not helped when, for a brief period during the early period of the pandemic, India restricted the export of certain APIs and drugs. As a major trading partner of India for pharmaceuticals \u2013 the US market represents the destination of 54% of India\u2019s drug, pharmaceutical and fine-chemicals exports \u2013 this will have raised alarm bells for the US government.\n\nHowever, one of the greater challenges during the early parts of the pandemic was one of access \u2013 with much of the world limited in terms of movement. The US FDA plays a key role in ensuring the quality of drugs that are being manufactured and brought into the country, a task that became fundamentally more difficult alongside the pandemic.\n\nLast year, the FDA published a report detailing its efforts to carry out its work during the pandemic and its plans to address postponed inspectional work. By its own figures, the agency managed 61% of the planned inspections it had scheduled for 2020. As a result of the pandemic, the FDA has had to \u2018roll over\u2019 any missed inspections into the following year, meaning that its planned inspections grew from 21,000 in 2020 to 26,250 in 2021. As a means to navigate the pandemic environment, the FDA carried out in-person inspections for only facilities considered high-risk, while opting to rely on remote interactive evaluations for low- and moderate-risk facilities.\n\nAll of these factors have led to a reduction in foreign inspections, with the agency reporting that between April and September 2021, it had carried out 37 human drugs-related inspections. Though the work carried out by the agency could not be carried on as normal due to the pandemic, this did not stop the United States Government Accountability Office releasing a report calling for improvements to its foreign inspection program.\n\nWith a greater political emphasis on improving domestic manufacturing of treatments, the industry itself is being pushed, in turn, by the FDA to strengthen its own supply chain. In a release last month, the agency called on companies to mitigate or prevent drug shortages due to \u201cdrug quality problems, vulnerabilities in the global supply chain, unanticipated increases in demand, market withdrawals of drugs, or natural disasters.\u201d As part of its recommendation, the agency called on companies to develop, maintain, and implement risk management plans for their supply chains.\n\nHow industry is reacting\n\nFor the industry\u2019s part, PhRMA published a report last year where it suggested that it would improve supply chain capacity and highlighted the importance of investing in pandemic preparedness and planning. The industry had been helped in this goal through the huge amount of funding that went into boosting capacity for vaccines and for vaccines supplies through Operation Warp Speed, with a significant portion of this investment seeing facility expansions in the US.\n\nBroader than just products related to the pandemic, there have also been strategic investments made to cater to the political demand for greater domestic manufacturing in other areas. Jackson Healthcare announced last year that it would reopen a US manufacturing facility for the production of antibiotics, after acquiring the site and operating the business through its subsidiary, USAntibiotics. The company stated that it would become the only US company able to manufacture amoxicillin and would be able to meet the country\u2019s entire demand for the antibiotic once the facility was operational.\n\n\u201cAs the first doses of USAntibiotics\u2019 life-saving drugs move down the assembly line, America will have declared its independence from Chinese antibiotics,\u201d said Rick Jackson, founder, CEO, and chairman of Jackson Healthcare, at the same time as the facility reopening was announced. A spokesperson for USAntibiotics declined to provide further details on the company\u2019s plans and the wider supply chain issues in the US.\n\nThere is clearly a growing appetite across the industry to call attention to expanding manufacturing presence within the US. Only last month, Eli Lilly unveiled a $2.1 billion investment for two US manufacturing facilities in Indiana and underlined the company\u2019s history in the area. While manufacturing projects for proprietary products will remain feasible in the US, where the necessary infrastructure and talent is a significant aid, it remains to be seen whether the industry will make similar moves in low profit areas, such as in genetics and antibiotics. However, while the direction of travel in politics is clearly moving towards greater domestic manufacturing, the industry can expect greater calls for this to happen.",
    "Industry veterans simplify sourcing and procurement for hospital administrators and healthcare suppliers\n\nVamstar, the leading AI-enabled global sourcing and procurement platform for medical supplies and pharmaceuticals, announced the close of its $9.5 million Series A funding round. Alpha Intelligence Capital (AIC) and Dutch Founders Fund (DFF) led the round, which also included existing investors btov Partners and Antler.\n\nAI and ML News: Why SMBs Shouldn\u2019t Be Afraid of Artificial Intelligence (AI)\n\n\u201cWe see a tremendous opportunity in a market that is largely underserved for the Vamstar platform to organize the procurement system in the healthcare industry\u201d\n\nVamstar will use this investment to accelerate market and product development plans, deploying Artificial Intelligence (AI) to enhance its consumables and generics exchange platform, improving data quality for faster e-commerce, and digitizing procurement and sourcing processes for both buyers and suppliers across the industry.\n\nThe healthcare industry lacks an organized procurement system that integrates data, processes, people, and technology across the supply chain. Despite advances in other industries, hospital procurement processes have not integrated digitally with suppliers\u2019 commercial processes, leading to supply chain inefficiencies. Not only is there a need to realize the benefits of digitizing sourcing and procurement processes to reduce transaction costs, but to improve the data foundation to drive value-based healthcare.\n\nDigitizing Healthcare Commerce\n\nVamstar was founded in 2019 by industry veterans Praful Mehta, Richard Freeman, Ph.D., and Vishesh Duggar to tackle the problem at the root of sourcing and procurement transformation failures: data integrity and user engagement. Vamstar combines best-in-class functionality for streamlining healthcare sourcing and procurement processes by using Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Natural Language Processing to connect billions of data points across the supply chain network, provide real-time market intelligence, and enable digital commerce through a common e-procurement platform. Vamstar, in collaboration with the University of Sheffield and the University of Nottingham, have won Innovate U.K. funding for several high-profile projects including post-COVID recovery to help monitor supply chain risk, and supply-demand matching by creating the largest healthcare supply chain network.\n\nTop Artificial Intelligence Insights: Determining the Potential of Your AI Algorithm Starts with Measurement\n\n\u201cWe see a tremendous opportunity in a market that is largely underserved for the Vamstar platform to organize the procurement system in the healthcare industry,\u201d said Terry Chou, Partner at Alpha Intelligence Capital \u201cThe Company\u2019s advanced Natural Language Processing capability sets them apart from other offerings. Paired with the strategic vision of the founders Praful, Richard, and Vishesh, Vamstar is setting the standard for procurement-enablement in healthcare.\u201d\n\n\u201cHealthcare supply chains are under tremendous pressure with ongoing crises like COVID-19, the war in Ukraine, and rising inflation,\u201d said Vamstar founder and CEO Praful Mehta. \u201cThere is very little data available to help healthcare procurement managers and suppliers make decisions in real-time. At Vamstar, our goal is to empower supply chain professionals, clinicians, hospital administrators and their suppliers to collaborate in innovative ways to create meaningful relationships. It is only by enabling a shared vision for collaboration, fueled by better data and insights, that we can deliver greater value for all stakeholders and the wider community within the healthcare ecosystem.\u201d\n\nVamstar connects both buyers and suppliers electronically to automate transaction and process flow across the supply chain on a global scale. The platform is used by businesses and organizations connecting suppliers, such as pharmaceuticals, consumables, medical devices, and digital technology companies, with public and private buyers, such as hospitals, laboratories, health insurances, clinics, corporations, universities or Group Purchasing Organizations (GPOs).\n\nBuyers can use Machine Learning to search across suppliers and their catalogs; launch tenders and sourcing events using automated workflows; receive bids and quotes in a prioritized sequence; and place orders electronically and automate the source-to-pay (S2P) processes. Suppliers on the other hand can get prioritized access to tenders, RFXs, and direct orders from 86,000 hospitals and clinics across 100+ countries directly or within their Customer Relationship Management (CRM) and Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) platforms; get access to Machine Learning (ML) forecasts and Natural Language Processing (NLP) enriched catalog and tender award data with virtual supplier profiles, and receive orders electronically and automate the order-to-cash (O2C) processes.\n\nRead More About AI News : AI Innovation Supports Rural and Remote Internet Connectivity\n\n[To share your insights with us, please write to sghosh@martechseries.com]",
    "For procurement leaders at industrial companies, the past 18 months have been difficult. Resurgent economic activity has collided with supply disrup-tions that have seemingly come one after another. Procurement executives know they need to respond but are unsure how. Most of them have not had a chance to anticipate the next set of problems\u2014let alone to quantify them.\n\nWhat procurement departments need is a comprehensive view of their supply chain vulnerabilities, organized around their companies\u2019 product lines. With this view in hand, they can secure the products that are most at risk. This article describes a holistic approach that companies can use to safeguard their sources of supply and make their organizations resilient. The approach focuses on three potential problems that every industrial company now faces in one way or another: absolute-shortage risk, supplier risk, and inflation risk (Exhibit 1).\n\nExhibit 1 We strive to provide individuals with disabilities equal access to our website. If you would like information about this content we will be happy to work with you. Please email us at: McKinsey_Website_Accessibility@mckinsey.com\n\nFirst risk scenario: Absolute shortage\n\nThe first supply chain risk is the unavailability of products that are essential for a business to operate. While a mid- and long-term view of commodities\u2014copper, steel, and cement\u2014is usually relatively straightforward, analysis becomes more complex for more processed products with longer supply chains. Those products use a combination of intermediate and raw materials. A greater number of inputs means more chances for structural shortages that could affect availability.\n\nProcurement departments should consider performing a classic supply-and-demand analysis. How much of a product will the company need in a specific year in the future, and how much of that product will be available to all vendors globally? This seemingly simple question rarely has a simple answer. It requires a bottom-up assessment of market reports, conversations with internal and external resource experts, and a study of the steps being taken by others who are also trying to secure the product. The resulting supply-and-demand calculations should become part of a regularly updated briefing report\u2014a library of category shortages, so to speak\u2014that companies can use to inform decision making.\n\nThe goal of the analysis is to position a company\u2019s procurement categories on a continuum, with \u201ccontinuity risk\u201d (the highest level of concern) on one end and \u201cno immediate danger\u201d on the other.\n\nFor example, after doing just such an analysis, one European energy company identified continuity risks in approximately one-third of its procurement categories. Only a small fraction of the risks arose from directly sourced materials; the majority of the continuity risks were related to indirectly sourced products that were further upstream in the supply chain. Those at-risk categories of supplies\u2014where supply-and-demand deficits were evident\u2014became the targets of mitigation actions. Where it could, the company entered into long-term, high-volume contracts for the supplies.\n\nSecond risk scenario: Supplier defaults\n\nOver the course of five or ten years, it\u2019s almost inevitable that at least one of a company\u2019s suppliers will go out of business. If the failed supplier is in a peripheral area, the failure may not be much more than a temporary inconvenience. But if the supplier furnishes an essential material or product along a path that leads to a major source of revenue, the consequences of supplier failure can be devastating.\n\nPart of the challenge lies in what\u2019s unseen. Companies are often aware of problems at their tier-one suppliers\u2014either because there\u2019s a delay in delivery or because the supplier communicates about the problem to get ahead of market rumors. The invisible part\u2014the part that companies almost never know\u2014is what\u2019s happening with the suppliers that the tier-one supplier itself depends on. The only way to be sure of a tier-one supplier\u2019s health is to have a view of what\u2019s happening in tiers two, three, and sometimes even four.\n\nThe only way to be sure of a tier-one supplier\u2019s health is to have a view of what\u2019s happening in tiers two, three, and sometimes even four.\n\nThe risks that companies need to look at for their direct suppliers\u2014and often for their indirect suppliers as well\u2014fall into seven dimensions:\n\nOperational. This dimension involves understanding how suppliers have set up their sourcing networks. Crucial questions include whether the supplier has visibility into its own suppliers, how concentrated the different supply sources are, and how well the supplier performs in areas such as lead time and on-time, in-full (OTIF) delivery, a metric of effectiveness in fulfilling orders.\n\nStructural. A supplier\u2019s tier-two or -three suppliers may face external or internal shocks in the form of trade divergence, climate events, or local challenges, including epidemics or conflicts with neighboring countries. The existence of such shocks doesn\u2019t necessarily prevent a company from getting what it needs from a supplier. But it might be a reason not to depend solely on one supplier.\n\nFinancial. Suppliers of every size and in every sector can face challenges related to corporate liquidity, credit ratings, and revenue concentration. One way or another, effective procurement executives should ensure that the financial risks of an individual supplier don\u2019t lead to product shortfalls at their manufacturing plants.\n\nRegulatory. Procurement executives need to understand whether their suppliers have the oversight in place to meet regulations. This could become trickier in the future as downstream companies are increasingly held to account for activities in their upstream supply chains, including activities related to CO2 emissions.\n\nData security. Security breaches can hurt seemingly stable suppliers in many ways, such as by leaving their systems inaccessible, by causing them to lose customer data, or by allowing misinformation to be sent out in their names. Such breaches can also interfere with delivery schedules and affect downstream customers. The due diligence that is required revolves around tier-two and tier-three suppliers\u2019 cybersecurity standards and intellectual-property policies.\n\nReputational. Companies sometimes make news because of questionable activities. When this happens to a supplier, a downstream manufacturer may be forced to sever its relationship with that supplier to protect its own environmental, social, and governance (ESG) reputation.\n\nOrganizational maturity. Suppliers vary in their tenure and in their risk management capabilities and culture. What we\u2019re calling \u201corganizational maturity\u201d determines how deftly a supplier can recover from the inevitable problems that arise in business and how well it can handle future contingencies. This trait allows companies to minimize the negative effects of the other six sources of risk.\n\nAfter performing these assessments, a company should have a central view of the risk associated with each of its key suppliers.\n\nAfter performing these assessments, a company should have a central view of the risk associated with each of its key suppliers. Those risks can be plotted against a \u201cdependency\u201d or business criticality score. Exhibit 2 shows an actual company\u2019s supplier risk dashboard with the supplier names removed. The company has used white bubbles to plot its suppliers, with the size of the bubble showing the relative amount it spends with each supplier. On the dual-axis chart, the company has overlaid three recommended actions: \u201cactively mitigate\u201d (for the suppliers that represent the biggest risk), \u201cdevelop mitigation plan\u201d (for suppliers whose risk may necessitate a plan in the future), and \u201ccontinue to monitor\u201d (for the suppliers that pose no current risk). In a dashboard like this, the red zone tells companies which suppliers they should immediately look at.\n\nExhibit 2 We strive to provide individuals with disabilities equal access to our website.

In ten of those cases, the supplier\u2019s risk was caused by an issue at one of its own suppliers. The materials conglomerate would never have known about those risks had it not looked deeper into its supply chain and investigated its tier-two suppliers. The analysis also allowed the conglomerate to undertake mitigation steps.\n\nThird risk scenario: Out-of-control inflation\n\nShortages aren\u2019t always absolute. A relative shortage\u2014that is, when supply exists but is insufficient\u2014can also lead to price volatility.\n\nFor instance, the price of many metals has gone up, often dramatically, during the past few years. Nickel is a case in point: the price of this metal, widely used in electric-vehicle batteries, has soared. There have also been other shortages amid the upheaval of the past few years. For instance, high demand has driven up the price of basic materials such as sawlogs and timber. Many industries\u2014including packaging and paper goods\u2014have felt the effects of these price increases.\n\nIt isn\u2019t only the difference between materials supply and demand that is raising costs. There has also been an imbalance in labor supply and demand. Together, base-materials inflation and services inflation have handed corporate-procurement departments a problem that seems to be growing exponentially.\n\nTo identify the places where inflation can hurt them the most\u2014and to minimize wasted effort\u2014companies need a clear methodology, such as the following three-step process: In step one, a company takes a cleansheet approach and uses comparative values or bills of materials to determine the share of a product\u2019s price that comes from raw materials versus from services. These calculations help create a baseline for understanding how the price might develop over time.\n\nIn step two, the company models the expected price changes for all the raw materials and service types that are involved. Typically, they do so by tri-angulating a variety of sources, including forecasts, market models, and expert assessments.\n\nIn step three, the company ranks the risk of inflation in its top supply categories. The accuracy of this ranking is largely dependent on the analysis done up to this point. But it is also crucial to calculate how long an increase in a raw material\u2019s price would take to drive up costs for a company buying it. In the chemicals industry, for instance, many contracts call for index-based pricing with monthly adjustments. Where these contracts exist, as they do for some commodities, the price realization is typically close to 100 percent. There are also industrial sectors where contracts call for prices to be fixed for two years. The realization of those price increases is much slower.\n\nIn practice, the inflation forecast can usually be accelerated through analytics. This automates part of the process and allows for an earlier discussion of inflation and volatility risk.\n\nOne company that used the three-step approach was able to fully analyze its spending baseline within three weeks. By the end of that period, the company realized that a significant portion of the materials it relied on were going to be affected by inflation. This realization allowed the company to do some renegotiation and repricing. Had it not done this, several significant projects would have ended up in the red.\n\nThe end goal: A business continuity heat map\n\nEven a company facing risks in every single one of its procurement categories would have to weigh the risks against one another and make distinctions. Some risks are simply bigger and more existential than others. Taking a systematic approach yields a clear picture of which supply category risks need attention immediately and which can wait (Exhibit 3).\n\nExhibit 3 We strive to provide individuals with disabilities equal access to our website. If you would like information about this content we will be happy to work with you. Please email us at: McKinsey_Website_Accessibility@mckinsey.com\n\nFor each procurement category that a company is concerned about, the heat map helps capture the degree of risk, prioritized from highest to lowest. There are three priority levels:\n\nPriority one: Immediate action is needed. These are the most at-risk procurement categories. Priority one categories usually involve a major source of revenue hanging in the balance. The problem is typically an absolute supply shortage or the imminent disappearance of a sole supply source for which there is no current alternative.\n\nPriority two: Action is needed in the medium term. A disruption in these procurement categories could create inefficiencies and hurt profitability. Disruption would not, however, threaten the company\u2019s ability to generate revenue altogether, nor would it threaten the company\u2019s survival. Priority two calls for some initial strategy work, but companies don\u2019t have to implement the strategies developed at this priority level in the near term.\n\nPriority three: No immediate action is needed. This priority indicates that a procurement category has little to no significant scarcity risk and that there is no inflation on the horizon.\n\nA European energy company was under the impression that about 15 percent of its procurement spending was in categories that carried a continuity risk. A heat map helped the company discover that in fact, twice that amount of spending (30 percent) was in areas that were at high risk. This realization allowed the company to take steps to secure its most critical supplies, including adding a local second source of supply for a crucial product.\n\nMany procurement leaders have turned to this methodology amid the disruptions of the past 18 months to understand which supply categories are at risk of shortages. But there is no reason to treat the work as a one-time effort. The methodology should be used continuously and more broadly by organizations\u2014including buyers with day-to-day responsibilities for specific categories.\n\nFurthermore, the insights should not stay within the procurement department. If procurement\u2019s analysis shows that inflation is about to hit a key supply category, that should start a conversation between procurement and sales so that the sales team can pass the higher cost through to customers if necessary. Similarly, if an analysis shows that a sole supplier is in danger of going out of business, that should prompt a conversation with the R&D or manufacturing team about finding alternative suppliers.\n\nIn other words, the methodology\u2019s most powerful application is to provide an end-to-end tool for cross-functional collaboration and problem solving.\n\nTo expand the methodology\u2019s value in this way will require a holistic setup and the development of certain processes, tools, and capabilities. Procurement departments that make the investment will be building early warning systems and contributing to their organizations\u2019 resilience.",
    "Clinical trials have both predictable and unpredictable demand. Predictable demand accounts for known patients that are enrolled in the trial, have been assigned a Treatment Group, and have a defined visit schedule. Supply chain complexity is introduced primarily due to the unpredictable demand, which can stem from shifts in the expected enrollment rates as well as the ripple effect from protocol amendments throughout the study.\n\nFor example, patient enrollment can vary widely within regions, countries and sites due to competitive enrollment and other variables, such as discontinuation rate, titration probabilities, and patient physiology, all of which directly impact site demand and resupply strategies. Protocol amendments may add new treatment arms, extend the visit schedule, and/or add countries, all of which impact the supply chain.\n\nThis unpredictability introduces risk into the supply chain. It is critical for Clinical Supply Chain Managers to be aware of these risks and understand how best to mitigate them within their trials. Below, we highlight key areas of risk and how technology can help supply managers.",
    "COLLEGE PARK, Md.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--IonQ (NYSE: IONQ), an industry leader in quantum computing, today announced promising early results with its partner, GE Research, to explore the benefits of quantum computing for modeling multi-variable distributions in risk management.\n\nLeveraging a Quantum Circuit Born Machine-based framework on standardized, historical indexes, IonQ and GE Research, the central innovation hub for the General Electric Company (NYSE: GE), were able to effectively train quantum circuits to learn correlations among three and four indexes. The prediction derived from the quantum framework outperformed those of classical modeling approaches in some cases, confirming that quantum copulas can potentially lead to smarter data-driven analysis and decision-making across commercial applications. A blog post further explaining the research methodology and results is available here.\n\n\u201cTogether with GE Research, IonQ is pushing the boundaries of what is currently possible to achieve with quantum computing,\u201d said Peter Chapman, CEO and President, IonQ. \u201cWhile classical techniques face inefficiencies when multiple variables have to be modeled together with high precision, our joint effort has identified a new training strategy that may optimize quantum computing results even as systems scale. Tested on our industry-leading IonQ Aria system, we\u2019re excited to apply these new methodologies when tackling real world scenarios that were once deemed too complex to solve.\u201d\n\nWhile classical techniques to form copulas using mathematical approximations are a great way to build multi-variate risk models, they face limitations when scaling. IonQ and GE Research successfully trained quantum copula models with up to four variables on IonQ\u2019s trapped ion systems by using data from four representative stock indexes with easily accessible and variating market environments.\n\nBy studying the historical dependence structure among the returns of the four indexes during this timeframe, the research group trained its model to understand the underlying dynamics. Additionally, the newly presented methodology includes optimization techniques that potentially allow models to scale by mitigating local minima and vanishing gradient problems common in quantum machine learning practices. Such improvements demonstrate a promising way to perform multi-variable analysis faster and more accurately, which GE researchers hope lead to new and better ways to assess risk with major manufacturing processes such as product design, factory operations, and supply chain management.\n\n\u201cAs we have seen from recent global supply chain volatility, the world needs more effective methods and tools to manage risks where conditions can be so highly variable and interconnected to one another,\u201d said David Vernooy, a Senior Executive and Digital Technologies Leader at GE Research. \u201cThe early results we achieved in the financial use case with IonQ show the high potential of quantum computing to better understand and reduce the risks associated with these types of highly variable scenarios.\u201d\n\nToday\u2019s results follow IonQ\u2019s recent announcement of the company\u2019s new IonQ Forte quantum computing system. The system features novel, cutting-edge optics technology that enables increased accuracy and further enhances IonQ\u2019s industry leading system performance. Partnerships with the likes of GE Research and Hyundai Motors illustrate the growing interest in our industry-leading systems and feeds into the continued success seen in Q1 2022.\n\nAbout IonQ\n\nIonQ, Inc. is a leader in quantum computing, with a proven track record of innovation and deployment.

    "After the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the world of business will never be the same again. Deputy Attorney General (DAG) Lisa Monaco recently said that the world\u2019s \u201cgeopolitical landscape is more challenging and complex than ever. The most prominent example is of course Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine.\u201d It is \u201cnothing less than a fundamental challenge to international norms, sovereignty and the rule of law that underpins our society.\u201d This is even more so in the current business climate.\n\nOver this five-part series, I will consider how business will never again be the same and how a confluence of events of events has changed business forever. I am joined in this exploration by Brandon Daniels, Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Exiger. We will explore the irrevocable changes in Supply Chain, trade and economic sanctions, anti-corruption, cyber-security and environmental, social and governance (ESG). In Part 4, we continue to explore the changes wrought by the Russian invasion of Ukraine, in the realm of cybersecurity.\n\nThe Russian invasion of Ukraine gave everyone else an understanding of how serious cybersecurity really was from a defense perspective and not just from a corporate risk management perspective. According to Daniels, it drove home the clear message in cybersecurity that the United States is in a non-kinetic war with Russia and China. Over the past decade the theft of intellectual property (IP) through cybercrime has steadily increased but Russia and China are essentially \u201cshowering the US with attacks\u201d and specifically Russia is attempting to compromise \u201cUS facilities and technologies since the crisis\u201d began.\n\nA second and equally important point on cybersecurity, is how interconnected it is to commerce. Countries such as Russia and China are clearly using both state and non-state businesses to further the ambitions of the state. These attacks have been particularly prevalent in supply chain where 80% of the largest cyber-attacks that have occurred, have been supply chain attacks. This means that you may have integrated some software into your organization through a vendor, but somewhere earlier in that software development, in that vendor\u2019s purchasing of under underlying software capabilities, there was a malicious piece of software that was planted by a state-owned actor, a non-state actor or a criminal network. This interconnectedness between third party and supply chain, risk management and cyber risk management was made so much more explicit from the Russian invasion of Ukraine.\n\nDaniels pointed out that companies may have \u201cvendors that are owned one to two degrees away by Russian oligarchs and those Russian oligarchs might be using the fact that we use their software one to two degrees away as an entry point to steal classified information about what the US government is doing in\u201d an area such as critical infrastructure. Once again, the nature of cybersecurity and its interconnectedness with third party and supplier risk management, was \u201canother revelation that came out of this crisis and this conflict.\u201d\n\nOne of the continuing themes from the Russian invasion of Ukraine is the interconnectedness of risks which will never be the same. Some of these we have previously explored such as supply chain, trade and economic sanctions and anti-bribery and anti-corruption. There are others such as crypto and ESG as well. This can all lead to a perception of complexity which could overwhelm risk management and other business professions thinking through how to manage these risks.\n\nDaniels suggested an approach which assesses your vendors in their environment for four quadrants of risk: operational, foreign ownership, financial health and reputational risk. After you have established your risk appetite you will need to assess every vendor on an individual and singular basis. You should have a process where each vendor coming through your company\u2019s pipeline follows an onboarding process that manages to your risk appetite and then monitors for risks that could pull a vendor above your risk threshold. If a vendor falls outside of your risk appetite for any of these key areas, you should review the use of that vendor in more detail.\n\nThere are other risk profiles you should consider. One is industry risk, which means what critical industries are you relying upon. Daniels noted that a cloud hosting company should be concerned with computing resources, bandwidth, power, or fiber optic resources. He said, \u201cDon\u2019t try to boil the ocean, just look at your critical industries and see where you might have issues that are coming up that could be problematic\u201d for your industry.\n\nFinally, another key risk area to consider is jurisdictional risk. This means reviewing the locations of your facilities. Daniels said, \u201cI look at where my top or most critical products are being manufactured. Again, if I\u2019m a cloud hosting company, it might be the microelectronics that I use to power computing resources, to determine where the concentration of manufacturing locations.\u201d But the key is to take it in bite size chunks by company, industry, and jurisdiction, and then monitor so you can at least maintain a reactive posture on upcoming events. By doing so this enables your company to do continuous maturing and evolution thereby increasing complexity and efficacy to continuously improve that program to start to work towards proactive risk management.\n\n[View source.]",
    "Global supply chain risk and resilience\n\nRichard Baldwin, Rebecca Freeman\n\nSupply disruptions caused by systemic shocks such as Brexit, Covid, and Russia-Ukraine tensions have catapulted the issue of risk in global supply chains to the top of policy agendas. In some sectors, however, there is a wedge between private and social risk appetite, or increased risks due to lack of supply chain visibility. This column discusses the types of risks to and from supply chains, and how supply chains have recovered from past shocks. It then proposes a risk-reward framework for thinking about when policy interventions are necessary.\n\nThe past couple of years have been rife with upheaval \u2013 whether we are speaking of people\u2019s day-to-day lives, disruptions to business-as-usual, or international trade flows. The Brexit shock in Britain sparked initial concerns about the impact on global supply chains (GSCs). This was followed by the much larger and wider shock from the Covid-19 pandemic. The current political situation between Russia and Ukraine, including many countries\u2019 sanctions and bans on the import of Russian products, is likely to perpetuate the spectre of broad and long-lasting shocks to multiple economies.\n\nWhat should be done about this? Noting many challenges to GSC resilience, Seric et al. (2021) examine how firms involved in GSCs can help mitigate the effects of supply disruptions. Further, recent research on GSC risks has shown that inventory management helps firms mitigate GSC shocks (Lafrogne-Joussier et al. 2022).\n\nThis column, based on Baldwin and Freeman (2021), (1) examines how the literature has thought about sources of shocks, risk and resilience in the context of GSCs, including whether a shift in the thinking around risk is called for; and (2) offers a brief discussion on how to apply our proposed framework to policy discussions and future work on the topic.\n\nSources of shocks\n\nGSCs are composed of firms and firms face risks. Some of these risks are exogenous supply and demand shocks, other shocks emanate from other firms or transportation disruptions.\n\nSupply shocks include \u2018classic\u2019 disruptions such as natural disasters, labour union strikes, suppliers going bankrupt, industrial accidents, and so on (Miroudot 2020), as well as disruptions from broader sources like trade and industrial policy changes, and political instability. They can be concentrated (e.g. the 2011 Japan earthquake) or broad (e.g. the Covid-19 pandemic).\n\nTransportation is part of the services sector, and thus potentially subject to different shocks than goods.\n\nDemand shocks confront firms with risks stemming from damage to product and company reputation, customer bankruptcy, entry of new competitors, policies restricting market access, macroeconomic crises, and exchange rate volatility.\n\nAnother important dimension of risk concerns the idiosyncratic-versus-systematic nature of shocks. Most firms involved in GSCs are aware of idiosyncratic shocks \u2013 those which affect single sectors or factories in single nations. These are frequent. Systemic shocks are a different matter.\n\nFrom the 1990s until recently, shocks rarely involved many sectors/nations simultaneously. This is really what was new about the Covid-19 shocks to GSCs, which were pervasive, persistent, and affected multiple sectors at once. And while many firms do have contingency strategies in place, few firms engaged in GSCs \u2013 not even the most sophisticated multinationals \u2013 had prepared for systemic shocks. This is a real change.\n\nThe Business Continuity Institute Supply Chain Resilience Report 2021, which surveyed 173 firms in 62 countries, found that over a quarter of firms experienced ten or more disruptions in 2020, while the figure was under 5% in 2019. Firms cited Covid-19 for most of the rise in disruptions, although Europe-based firms also pointed to Brexit as an important source of shocks.\n\nThere are two other likely sources of systemic shocks: climate change and geostrategic tensions. In short, systemic shocks may become the norm and thus require changes to business models worldwide.\n\nEven though the pandemic waxed and waned regionally, it has been global in nature. Because of this, the impact was felt in almost all goods producing sectors. We cannot know how frequently future pandemics or disruptive global events will occur, but it is likely that Covid-19 will continue to be disruptive for many months or years.\n\nEconomic analysis of GSC risks, resilience, and robustness\n\nThe literature has focused on three aspects of GSC risks:\n\nThe propagation of micro into macro shocks\n\nWhether GSCs amplify the trade impact of macro shocks\n\nThe costs and effects of delinking/decoupling from GSCs (e.g. through reshoring).\n\nOur paper reviews these three literatures, but for the sake of space, we concentrate on policy issues here. Before doing so, we touch upon the critical distinction between resilience (ability to bounce back quickly after a shock) and robustness (ability to continue production during the shock). To ensure resilience, much of the focus is on designing the supply chain with an eye to the riskiness of locations overall. In contrast, robustness strategies focus more on ensuring redundancy of external suppliers or having multiple production sites for internally produced inputs (Martins de Sa et al. 2019, Brandon-Jones et al. 2014).\n\nDo we need new GSC policies?\n\nA touchstone principle of the social market economy is that government intervention is merited if there are gaps between the private and public evaluations of costs, benefits, and/or risks. When it comes to GSC policy, we argue that policy may improve market outcomes when there is a wedge between private and social evaluations of risk.\n\nWe illustrate this for GSCs with a \u2018wedge diagram\u2019 (Figure 1). The diagram, styled on classic optimal-portfolio analysis, has risk and reward on the y-axis and the x-axis, respectively. Firms like cost-savings and dislike risk (as shown by the indifference curves), but their choices are constrained by the fundamental risk-reward frontier shown. The frontiers take their shape since putting all production in the cheapest location increases risk by decreasing geo-diversification.\n\nWhere does the wedge come from? Public versus private risk appetite. In the GSC world, divergences in public-private risk preferences can arise from a range of mechanisms whereby individual firms do not internalise the full risk of their actions. Private firms optimally choose point P given their preferences. In some sectors, many governments have preferences that give greater weight to risk reduction, so the public trade-off leads to a lower-risk optimum, creating a wedge between public and private risk evaluations. This divergence is clear in sectors such as banking where, in the past, government provided guarantees when the risk went wrong, and in food production where individual producers underinvest in anti-famine actions.\n\nMisperception of the location of the frontier. Another market failure can arise due to information asymmetries. Modern GSC are massively complex and even the most sophisticated firms can be unaware of the location of their third-tier suppliers and beyond (Lund et al. 2020). As a result, private firms may face more risk than they know. This situation is depicted as the actual risk-reward trade-off taking place above the perceived trade-off, which would also result in a wedge. When this is the case, private firms are at point P\u2019 when they think they are at P.\n\nFigure 1 The public-private wedge analysis of GSC risks\n\nSource: Baldwin and Freeman (2021).\n\nPolicies to mitigate risk\n\nRisk mitigating policies \u2013 such as those in banking and agriculture \u2013 are clearly warranted when such a public-private wedge exists. Banking is the classic sector with a wedge, but food has one as well given that it is almost universally considered too critical to national wellbeing to be left to the market. Most nations have policies that promote domestic production create buffer stocks to smooth demand and supply mismatches, or both. These typically involve large scale outlays such the US Farm Bill and the EU's Common Agricultural Policy.\n\nIt seems likely that critical sectors, including medical supplies and semiconductors, will be viewed more like agriculture and banking going forward than they have been, since the perception is that they are marked by a public-private wedge. Policies that tackle the wedge can be usefully classified into tax/subsidy measures, regulatory measures, and direct governmental control. And, as firms are more likely to shift production structures when they perceive a permanent policy shift (Antr\u00e0s 2020), we speculate that these sectors are most likely to restructure and reorganise their GSCs. On the policy side, there have been clear moves to evaluate critical sectors. For example, the Biden administration has established a Supply Chain Disruptions Task Force to address the challenges arising from a pandemic-affected economic recovery (White House 2022).\n\nA target-rich research environment\n\nWe end our paper, and this column, with a call for research. On the trade theory side, almost no analyses had delved into the role of risk in GSCs when we started circulating our paper in 2021. For example, in the received wisdom literature (Grossman and Rossi-Hansberg 2008), the basic trade-off turns on separation costs versus cost-saving gains in a model without risk. As the discussion of the International Business literature in our paper makes clear, the risk-GSC nexus serves up a rich menu of un-modelled, yet important phenomena. Of course, risk considerations are not entirely new (Costinot et al. 2013), but the theory has largely assumed away risk for convenience, and this has been echoed in the empirics.\n\nOn the empirical side, the possibilities are even greater. Nothing helps econometricians more than truly exogenous shocks. The years 2020 and 2021 were bursting with exogeneity. Because of this, coupled with the availability of massive, high-frequency, online data, and headline-grabbing importance, we conjecture that there is a great deal of impactful empirical research to be done on risk and the shape and nature of GSCs. Overall, we see exciting times ahead for GSC researchers. Things have, as they say, changed so much that not even the future is what it used to be. It is riskier than we thought!\n\nReferences\n\nAntr\u00e0s, P (2021), \u201cDe-globalisation?

    "A podcast from JAMS featuring neutrals Barbara A. Reeves, Esq., CEDS, and Katherine Hope Gurun, Esq., on the top challenges businesses are facing as a result of supply chain disruption and how ADR techniques can help.\n\nIn this podcast, JAMS neutrals Barbara A. Reeves, Esq., CEDS, and Katherine Hope Gurun, Esq., provide insight on the top considerations for companies impacted by constant supply chain disruption. Barbara and Katherine specifically draw on their years of experience working at JAMS and other organizations to provide helpful tips for businesses that are navigating disruptions brought on by the pandemic, climate change, the war in Ukraine and other crises, outlining how mediation and arbitration can provide a template to help resolve related disputes.\n\n[embedded content]\n\nJAMS - Transcript - Supply Chains\n\n[00:00:00] Moderator: Welcome to this podcast from JAMS. Today, we're going to be talking about some of the challenges many businesses are facing with supply chains and how to prepare for potential disputes. Two years of shutdowns from the pandemic wreaked havoc on how goods are assembled and delivered around the world, and now the war in Ukraine and sanctions against Russia are creating new challenges.\n\nIn this episode, we are joined by two JAMS neutrals with years of experience dealing with supply chain management issues at major corporations and now as mediators and arbitrators: Barbara Reeves, formerly associate general counsel and vice president for Southern California Edison and Edison International, and Katherine Hope Gurun, formerly senior vice president and general counsel at Bechtel Corporation.\n\nThank you both for joining us. Katherine, I'll start with you first. You have a lot of experience in risk management. What has stood out to you in terms of the challenges companies have faced since the onset of the pandemic?\n\n[00:00:58] Katherine Hope Gurun: I think initially during COVID, companies and industries were looking for short, stopgap solutions, waiting for things to return to normal. I think, in fact, we now know that normal may never be so normal again. Many companies, however, already have begun to analyze and overhaul their supply matrix to make it more sustainable. Remember, for years we worked on a just-in-time inventory basis. We worked to cut out the middleman everywhere we could.\n\nNow, unfortunately, we are looking to have a larger pool to deal with and to look for ways in which we can improve the supply chain and also build in redundancy. I think the challenge for all industries is not only how to get through this crisis, but how to be better prepared for the future. I can promise you that there are many first-rate companies who did not have a full understanding of their risk and protection under contracts or any other legal agreements in the event of a global pandemic, and certainly not in the event of a hot war. Everyone has been focused on keeping the business moving.\n\nI don't think that many people have thought about what will happen over time. How will we resolve these disputes? I think we know now that in these very difficult times, industries will benefit from using ADR mechanisms, particularly mediation.\n\n[00:02:16] Moderator: What are the benefits of using mediation to resolve some of these disputes?\n\n[00:02:20] Katherine Hope Gurun: Mediation can be very cost-effective. It puts business leaders in the driver\u2019s seat with the supportive legal counsel and an experienced mediator. Mediation can also bring multiple parties to the table for a better result.\n\n[00:02:33] Moderator: Barbara, can you tell us how some of these supply chain issues have played out in real mediations?\n\n[00:02:38] Barbara Reeves: Yes. Two years ago, when cases first started coming in that were, I thought, the usual complex commercial contract types of cases that I mediate, I didn't think anything special was happening. Gradually, I realized we were always talking about a problem, a breach of contract because somebody was in short supply of something, everything from computer chips to pharmaceuticals to athletic shoes.\n\nAs I looked at these, I realized that we had a supply chain or supply matrix disruption with common causes, and I started structuring a process for mediating these cases, business interruption cases. There are four points that I'd like to make about that. First, these cases have multiple parties. You have a buyer, a supplier, that supplier's supplier and other potential suppliers in the market who may have an interest. You may have a lender who has made a loan to somebody in this chain of supply who is now worrying about its loan and investors who are worrying about their equity in whatever company it is, or firm that is finding itself unable to perform as before.\n\nSo, the first point is you have multiple parties. Can you get them all into one room? The second point is they're usually in multiple jurisdictions, which could be international\u2014usually is international\u2014certainly can be in multiple states, whether it's around Europe, whether it's around the United States or in Asia.\n\nSo, you need a way to try to get people together. That doesn't work in court. It doesn't work in arbitration. So, we've been turning to mediation because the third point is you need the cooperation of the parties. When I was in-house, we had a major supply disruption, and we tried to handle that by negotiating with the different parties, and that involved suppliers. It involved a federal government agency. It involved a state government agency. And we continued to negotiate one at a time. This went on for a year. We weren't as sophisticated then\u2014this was back in the year 2000\u2014as we are today about mediation and how we can use it. One of the parties wouldn't cooperate, and it was very difficult to cooperate. And of course, if you've ever tried to get a governmental entity to cooperate, you know that can be difficult.\n\nSo on point three, the cooperation of parties is important. A mediator is a good intermediary, somebody who can bring the parties together by explaining. You may have an advantage in the short term by playing hardball, but step back and think, where do you want to be a year from now? When this disruption is over, the parties [will] probably want to be back doing business together again.\n\nThat goes on to point number four, which is these disputes tend to involve companies and governmental organizations that have ongoing relationships. So, while in the short term it's helpful, one party may view it as to its advantage to play hardball: Supply is short; let\u2019s raise the prices. If it winds up putting people out of business and companies out of business, causing employees to lose jobs and disrupting business relationships, when all of this is over, people are going to regret [it]. So, a mediator is a good person who can pull them all together. In a case I had last week, we had five parties, including not only the contracting parties, but an investor, a lender and a group of consumers who were being companies who were consuming it, who were being adversely impacted.\n\nWe managed to put together not a final deal, but a term sheet that talked about how the parties over the next 30 to 60 days were going to continue to negotiate to get this resolved. When people say, \u201cWell, why mediation?\u201d It's because, in my opinion, a mediator, when you get someone who's done a lot of these complex commercial cases\u2014I analogize it as looking at a maze. If you walk into a maze, you can see straight ahead a little way. You can see one opening to the left or the right, but you don't necessarily know\u2014you have no idea which way to go. A mediator who has done dozens of these cases looks at them in the same way as if you had an aerial view of the maze. If you could go straight up above the maze and take an aerial shot of it, you can see, \u201cOh, that's how this could work out.\u201d A mediator who's done a lot of these cases tends to see possible solutions and is also pretty good at talking to the parties and telling when they're bluffing and what their real interest is.\n\n[00:07:48] Moderator: Barbara, you mentioned a supply chain matrix. Can you just explain what that is?\n\n[00:07:53] Barbara Reeves: You know we use the phrase \u201csupply chain,\u201d but when you actually look at it, if you were to map out your supply chain, you would see that you buy from\u2014you, company A, buys from multiple parties.\n\nYou have supplies coming in left, right, and front and back. Each of the companies from whom you purchase also has supplies coming in left, right, front and back, and everybody has employees, many of whom are unable to participate for a while because of geopolitical restrictions or COVID. So, if you were to draw a picture of it, it would look more like a matrix or a spider web, not a straight chain.\n\nThat is the secret, or the key, to trying to resolve these. If I can't go straight ahead with my traditional relationship, forwards and backwards, maybe I can reach out sideways or diagonally to another supplier or\u2014as in the case that I mentioned earlier\u2014to an investor who has a connection to another supplier or a lender who has an interest in finding a way to make this work.\n\nIf you were to draw a picture of it, you realize you have nodes that are connected by lines to many different other nodes. So, it looks like a matrix, not just a supply chain.\n\n[00:09:15] Moderator: Katherine, what can companies do now to prepare for the next supply chain dispute?\n\n[00:09:20] Katherine Hope Gurun: So, first of all, companies should always and continuously update their risk management policies.\n\nRisks need to be assessed on an ongoing basis\u2014not only allocated, but reallocated. If you look at why companies fail or why projects fail, you'll often find that underlying assumptions were inaccurate\u2014perhaps based on old data, perhaps based on old assumptions. Remember also that the insurance market is constantly changing and you need to keep addressed with those changes. Risks which couldn't be covered by insurance 15 or 20 years ago or even five years ago can now be covered by insurance.\n\nSecondly, it's really important for companies to establish a risk register database for all of their contractual and legal agreements so that exposures can be mitigated perhaps in advance or quickly resolved as a crisis looms. When the first Gulf War happened, the first question was, what is our exposure? What does this contract say?\n\nTo have people reassessing those on a real-time basis really slows and delays the process, and sometimes dangerously. Thirdly, I think that everyone should be\u2014and I'm sure they are now\u2014focusing on updating their procurement practices and documentation. Lastly, companies should not wait until they have a dispute to figure out what their dispute resolution policy or practice is going to be.\n\nAs Barbara has made clear, many of these disputes will be international, so governing law and the forum for the disputes are going to be really key to successful settlement of them.\n\n[00:10:49] Moderator: Barbara, Katherine mentioned insurance. Can you talk a little bit about what role insurance plays in these supply disputes?\n\n[00:10:57] Barbara Reeves: Yes. Insurance obviously is the subject of another program that could take an hour.\n\nThe points to note right now are most companies have commercial general liability\u2014CGL\u2014policies, which are being interpreted by the courts these days to determine whether there are exclusions or whether they apply to everything from COVID to geopolitical problems to wars. So, if you look, the question is, do you have other specialty insurance, and can you get it?\n\nEverybody is looking at that now. There are specialty insurance policies, including contingent business interruption\u2014referred to as CBI\u2014policies and supply chain insurance that's available. Contingent business interruption, or CBI, [insurance] provides coverage against losses caused by disruptions at the locations of your suppliers and customers.\n\nSo, the question again is, what kind of problems, disruptions are covered? Are they only physical coverages, physical disruptions, or would it also include disruptions caused by things that governments have done, shutdowns or borders being closed? Supply chain insurance, as I've said, is now coming into vogue, and it can cover losses caused by, for example, natural disasters, labor issues, political upheaval, war, public health emergency and regulatory action.\n\nI've seen several of these policies. I hear they may be expensive. So, you need to look into those, but it's just something to remember to check, as Katherine said, when you're looking at your risk prevention.\n\n[00:12:38] Moderator: All right. Well, definitely another topic to pursue on another episode, but Katherine, in your many years of experience with international construction at Bechtel, can you recall instances where a supply chain approach reduced the number of actual disputes or where ADR techniques were more effective in resolving some of these disputes?\n\n[00:12:58] Katherine Hope Gurun: Yes. I want to give you just three quick examples. The first is when Bechtel first went to China. It was [during the] very early days. The published laws of China were about three inches thick, a little, small stack for joint-venture arrangements, and the rest of all Chinese laws were confidential. So, the first thing we did is to take Bechtel\u2019s normal approach to contracting and take it apart 100% and come up with a set of terms and conditions and important liability and risk allocation issues that could be covered in a brief contract, because in every case, we were both learning. We were learning from the Chinese. They were learning from us. Having this pre-work before we ever went to China, I think, served us extremely well.\n\nIn all of my time being in China and managing China, we only had two matters which actually went to formal dispute resolution. Simplify it if you can. Secondly, after the first Gulf War, Bechtel was very involved in the restoration of the Kuwait oil fields. In this case, we had to procure over $2 billion worth of expected material to be required for the restoration.\n\nWe didn't know when or if we would be allowed to return to Kuwait. We didn't know how difficult the job would be. So, to begin with, again, pre-work. We had some time, [so] we took apart our procurement and logistics practices completely. We stripped them back to the bare bones with an extremely small team with access to all senior management, and we rewrote and revised the entire supply and procurement practice for that job, which later went on to become a model for many future jobs.\n\nWe established strategic hubs all over the world and had a unique on-site procurement team and worked with the client, again, to establish a very unique insurance program that allowed us to do this restoration work in essentially a war setting. As a result of this pre-work, seven years of estimated time to put out the fires at $120 million a day was reduced to six months.\n\nSo, that was extremely important. I should add also that we diversified firefighting technology and looked for technology all over the world. Lastly, in the case of the Channel Tunnel Rail Link in the United Kingdom, a new practice was introduced in English law which allowed the parties to settle disputes as the project was ongoing, and this practice allowed them to craft a temporary solution.\n\nNot everything could be known at the time. The goal was to allow for the parties to keep the project moving and, if necessary, to come back and revisit the project later. This project is called adjudication. And in fact on that project, it was extremely successful. In the case of Bechtel, I can recall only one or two significant adjudications which were not revisited, but the project moved along and came in under budget and on time. So again, a very good approach. You don't have to know everything to settle a dispute, and this is always hard for both lawyers and businesspeople to accept, but it is the truth.\n\n[00:15:57] Barbara Reeves: I'd like to make one point. And that is, there are those of us who practice what is often called mixed-mode dispute resolution.\n\nAs a way of moving forward, decide that the mediator will turn into an arbitrator for one particular issue. There may be a contract term that needs to be interpreted. There may be a law that needs to be applied. And then the mediator mediates, then holds a brief hearing or has documents submitted, makes a ruling on one issue and then returns to mediation.\n\nAlternatively, a matter that starts in arbitration could switch into mediation. At some point, after the parties have presented their positions, they may turn to the arbitrator and say, \u201cWe would like to mediate this issue.\u201d It may be the entire case. It may be one claim. But if they can mediate it and then agree that if they resolve it, they'll go back to arbitration, or if they resolve that issue, they will then negotiate between themselves and settle it.\n\nSo it's called mixed mode. If you do it, you have to be careful. You have to sign the appropriate documents that confirm that the arbitrator may act as a mediator or the mediator may act as an arbitrator, and be clear about what result you want.\n\nIf you get a settlement, it may be a settlement that then gets reduced to a consent award as an arbitral award, and you want to make sure that it will be enforceable.\n\n[00:17:29] Moderator: Let's wrap it up with a forward-looking thought. How do you envision this playing out over the next six months to a year, Barbara?\n\n[00:17:37] Barbara Reeves: Yes. I think the only certainty is uncertainty. We thought when this started that we would be dealing with COVID for a year. Now it's going on longer, and who knows when the next outbreak is going to occur? Meanwhile, COVID has been slightly edged down the front page from the very top by the conflict in the Ukraine.\n\nAt the same time, we're seeing other countries in Europe\u2014Finland and Sweden\u2014applying to join NATO. We're seeing a number of changes, and we don't know what's going to happen on the geopolitical front next. The point that I've made repeatedly is when you don't know what's going to happen, be flexible. If you can't go left and you can't go right, go straight ahead. If you can't go straight ahead, be ready to go left, right or sideways, and to do that, you need flexibility.\n\nMediation is an answer, in my opinion, to how to have flexible dispute resolution with somebody who is a third party, an intermediary, a neutral who has experience and can guide the parties through to a long-term, successful resolution, notwithstanding the current uncertainty that we're all facing, and that we\u2019ll continue to face, I believe, in the next six months to a year.\n\n[00:18:53] Moderator: Okay. Being flexible is key. Katherine, what about you?\n\n[00:18:57] Katherine Hope Gurun: I would agree with everything Barbara said, but I would just say this. I think that we can now see that the ripple effect is likely to have been greatly underestimated. The effects of the invasion by Russia of Ukraine and the Russian sanctions are going to reach every corner of the world. Food supply, already drastically impacted by climate changes, is certainly going to be far more devastating with the invasion of Ukraine and both Russia and Ukraine are major producers of wheat and other agricultural products. So, I do think that the need for real-time flexibility and both technical expertise in terms of working around a major transportation [block] and other blocks are going to be significant.\n\nI think there's a huge role to play for real-time resolution of these projects.\n\n[00:19:47] Moderator: Well, I know we've only scratched the surface on this very complex topic, but you've given us a lot to chew on, Katherine and Barbara.

    "Soaring commodity prices and rising supply chain risk are stoking an \u201cinflationary feedback loop\u201d.\n\nRisks around the supply of critical commodities \u2013 such as oil \u2013 have begun to compound on each other, pushing up raw material and transportation costs, according to the Achilles Supply Chain Resilience Index (ASCRI). This in turn has led to demands for higher wages, pushing inflation even higher.\n\nMeanwhile, the Bank of England has predicted inflation in the UK will hit 11% in October.\n\nKatie Tamblin, chief product officer at Achilles, told Supply Management: \u201cThe price of oil goes sky high with Russia's invasion of Ukraine. And that impacts everything made with chemicals, or requires oil burning to be made. And so it impacts all semi finished and finished goods, plastics and everything else, either indirectly or directly. And so that pushes the price of everything else.\u201d\n\nTamblin explained that when energy prices go up, prices in the next tier of the supply chain usually also increase about three months later. If oil prices go up, three months later plastic prices will go up, then items made with plastics three months after that. Over a 12-18 month period, the price of oil will hit consumers.\n\n\u201cWhen everything made with plastics is more expensive, when my petrol is more expensive, then I demand higher wages. And that's the feedback loop, because then it all starts over again,\u201d she said. \u201cEveryone is demanding and commanding higher wages. We're seeing huge wage inflation pressure right now, and that impacts everything again.\n\n\u201cEverything that's manufactured requires people to either make it or get it where it needs to be. Those people need more money, because they're spending more on consumer goods. They demand higher wages, that impacts the cost of everything again.\u201d\n\nIn the second quarter of 2022 the ASCRI has tipped into the \u2018very high\u2019 risk zone, with a further decline predicted. It suggested the re-emergence of Covid in China and the conflict in Ukraine are responsible for the surge. A shift from consumer spending \u2013 from services to goods \u2013 has also impacted inflation.\n\nTamblin added there were actions procurement teams could take to combat this inflationary feedback, though emphasised this would vary by industry:\n\n\u2022 Longer term contracts where you can get more price visibility and insulate yourself against further price increases can be helpful.\n\n\u2022 Partner with suppliers, because sometimes suppliers will reduce the price if they can get a longer term agreement or they feel more in partnership with the procurement team. If you have a long-term relationship with a supplier, they might grant short-term relief on the price. Understand what is most important to your supplier, for those critical commodities, the ones that are really impacting you \u2013 and then try to leverage that.\n\n\u2022 If you're buying more semi-finished and finished goods, where those price increases have not yet totally rippled through, lock in the price now.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be critical that procurement teams look to avoid disruption, because you may not be able to avoid the price increase,\u201d Tamblin said. \u201cBut even worse than paying more is not being able to get supply. A lot of the price increases are happening because demand is greater than supply for these commodities. Even if you are paying a higher price, it's probably not a bad idea to lock in inventory of your critical items, just to make sure you can get it.\u201d\n\nShe added: \u201cWe're going to continue to see disruptions throughout the rest of the year. So you have to make a strategic choice as a procurement professional. Do I want to pay more, but be sure to continue production of my goods because I have the supply? Or do I want to risk prices coming down, but I may not be able to get the supply when I need it?\u201d\n\n\u261b Want to stay up to date with the news? Sign up to our daily bulletin.",

    "Report Shows Founders Encountering Shifting Headwinds, Retrenching in the Face of Adversity\n\nSAN FRANCISCO, June 23, 2022--(BUSINESS WIRE)--As VC-backed startups enter an unprecedented era of risk, a new report finds that rising costs, employee concerns and inflation weigh heavily on the minds of founders in 2022. The report, the Startup Risk Index 2022, released today from commercial insurtech Embroker, delves into the mindset of founders to understand the threats to their business and how they consider, plan and respond to them in a rapidly evolving market and fundraising landscape.\n\nThis press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20220623005306/en/\n\nThe report cites a range of issues from those inside a startup to external factors that are often outside of their control. In 2021, 32% of startup founders identified the rising cost of business as impacting their operations. But in 2022, the majority of founders (26%) cited increased debt as the number one internal risk to their business moving forward. The top three external risks founders are concerned with in 2022 are inflation (26%), supply chain shortages and interruptions (24%), and competition (23%).\n\nIn response to these rising concerns, 30% of founders said that controlling growth was one of their primary strategies for mitigating risk.\n\nIt is clear that as founders think about business risk, they are willing to take personal risks to drive success for their startup, but only to a point. In fact, 33% of founders said they would be willing to sacrifice their pride for the betterment of their startup, whereas 33% claimed they would not be willing to risk their reputation in such pursuits.\n\nFounders revealed the complex and at-times inconsistent relationship that they have with risk, as 63% consider themselves to be \"risk averse,\" while 65% later conceded that risk-taking is essential for business and necessary to grow.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"VC-funded startups enjoyed record fundraising and growth in 2021, but are now facing an increasing set of rapidly evolving challenges \u2013 including disruptions like public market instability, supply chain shortages, and inflation,\" said Matt Miller, Embroker CEO. \"Looking ahead to the remainder of 2022 and into the next year, founders will be forced to navigate new and emerging risks and make some hard decisions.\"\n\n\"While the challenges of today\u2019s business environment may portend doom, plenty of growth opportunities will arise,\" continued Miller. \"And if history tells us anything, founders are resilient. Founders are at their very core builders. In challenging economic conditions, things will break and need to be rebuilt or built from scratch.\"\n\nFounders Run the Risk Gamut: Risk Profiles\n\nThe report also explored how startup founders self-identify when it comes to risk. The breakdown of the different profiles of founders ranged from the fearless to the most conservative mindsets:\n\n17%: I\u2019m not afraid of risk and never will be. This is likely not my first startup.\n\n38%: For me, risk means opportunity and I look for it on a regular basis. It is how I grow my business.\n\n27%: I expect and prepare for risk. Risk is inevitable and I know what the consequences are and plan for any risks that may come my way.\n\n12%: Taking on risk is a balancing act. I\u2019m not afraid to take on risk but I need to have an adequate response should a risk occur.\n\n4%: I don\u2019t know yet as I\u2019m a first-time founder. I want my startup to grow but I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m prepared to handle all these risks.\n\n2%: I stay away from risk as much as possible.\n\nEmbroker developed a Risk Archetype Quiz as a free tool to help founders understand their individual risk tolerance and find out what kind of risk taker they are.\n\n\"Now is the right time for founders to look inside themselves and acknowledge their risk mindset. Identifying where they fall along this spectrum can help them learn how to balance both internal and external risks to strategically grow their business while protecting their bottom line, even as new risks begin to surface,\" concluded Miller.\n\nTo learn more about the risks startup founders are willing to take to grow their business, visit: www.embroker.com.\n\nMethodology:\n\nFor the Startup Risk Index 2022 report, Embroker surveyed over 500 U.S.-based VC-backed startup founders in February 2022. The survey was completed online and responses were random, voluntary and anonymous.\n\nAbout Embroker\n\nEmbroker is transforming commercial insurance by making it radically simple for businesses to get the right insurance at the best price.

    "For six months, school nutrition workers have begged Congress to extend pandemic-era meal waivers that have given educators more flexibility in feeding children. If allowed to expire June 30, millions of kids would be left without reliable access to food and thousands of districts will have to continue to cover inflated food prices amid supply chain issues and labor shortages.\n\nJust ahead of that deadline, lawmakers may finally have a solution. The bipartisan Keep Kids Fed Act of 2022, a reimagination of proposals earlier this spring that failed to gain traction, could extend these waivers through the end of the 2022-2023 school year.\n\nThe $3 billion bill would help educators offer free meals to children who qualify for reduced-price lunches and breakfast. It would reimburse schools at rates above inflation so they can afford to buy nutritious food. And it would lift penalties for schools if they are unable to meet nutritional guidelines due to supply chain constraints. For example, if the current wheat shortage means a school administrator cannot buy whole grain bread, they do not have to worry about being fined for replacing that missing menu item with white bread.\n\nREAD MORE: How Maine is trying to take food insecurity off kids\u2019 plates\n\nSponsors of the bill are hoping to push a vote this week so the bill can go through Congress and make it to the president\u2019s desk by the end of the month.\n\n\u201cWith 90 percent of our schools still facing challenges as they return to normal operations, this will give our schools and summer meal programs much-needed support to deal with ongoing food service issues,\u201d Sen. Debbie Stabenow, D-Mich., said in a statement.\n\nIf Congress does not act, \u201cthe end of the waivers are going to have an impact on every school district.\u201d\n\nSchool administrators usually budget and plan out meals for the fall semester in the spring, said Diane Pratt-Heavner of the School Nutrition Association. This year\u2019s challenges \u2013 like negotiating bids with vendors who ghost them, cancel orders or draw up escalation clauses for food orders amid decades-high inflation \u2013 have also made planning\u2019s challenges \u2013 like negotiating bids with vendors who ghost them, cancel orders or draw up escalation clauses for food orders amid decades-high inflation \u2013 have also made planning for summer\u2019s immediate needs more of a struggle more of a struggle.\n\nThe deadline to renew the waivers is just the latest stressor for school nutrition workers. When COVID shut down schools and whole communities in March 2020, cafeteria workers and nutrition administrators triaged food needs for kids and families who may have otherwise gone without. These waivers made it possible for kids to take school-provided meals out of the building, and also reimbursed schools for these meals. Traditionally, students had to eat cafeteria-provided meals at school to comply with federal regulations.\n\nInstead, workers dropped meals off at students\u2019 homes and allowed parents to pick up a week\u2019s worth of meals on campus. That went on for months.\n\n\u201cOur members are really exhausted at this point,\u201d Pratt-Heavner said.\n\nREAD MORE: How COVID funding could help improve air quality in schools\n\nIf Congress does not act, \u201cthe end of the waivers are going to have an impact on every school district,\u201d said Sebasthian Varas, a nutrition services director for the Canyons School District in northern Utah.\n\nAbout a quarter of the 3,400 students in his district qualified for free-and-reduced lunch before the pandemic, and the meal waivers have been helping feed them and their families. When his district alerted the community that those meals could go away because Congress might miss its deadline, families responded that the change would be a hardship for them, Varas said. The district already has been forced to close some of its distribution sites for summer meals due to uncertainty about funding due to uncertainty about funding. Constrained by tight household budgets and spiking gas prices, some families cannot afford to drive 15 extra miles to pick up those meals regularly, he said.\n\nVaras worries that the cost of inaction in Washington could last far past summer for some students.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want students to go hungry,\u201d Varas said. \u201cWe know there\u2019s a direct link between good nutrition and academic success.\u201d",
    "Words like supply chain and logistics first became household terms thanks to pandemic-related disruptions. Those disruptions aren't going away, which means organizations need new and better approaches for managing supply chain risk.\n\nThat's one of the important messages from Eric Kimberling, CEO of Third Stage Consulting. Supply chain managers should understand that focusing solely on cost is unlikely to help them manage today's disruption risks. Leaders may also need to consider new tools and understand why relying too heavily on specific vendors is a bad idea.\n\nDangers of key supplier overreliance Since supply chain management involves stakeholders across the organization -- operations, finance, sales and so on -- managing it well is incredibly complex. What are some strategies organizations can use to proactively manage potential risk and disruption? Eric Kimberling: To create a truly resilient supply chain -- one that's flexible and can adapt to whatever changes and curveballs we might get in the future -- we want to look at our processes and understand where the risks are. The pandemic and other events already exposed a lot of these risks. But there are probably existing risks that we haven't seen yet. So it's a matter of critically looking at the end-to-end supply chain processes, understanding where the bottlenecks are and understanding where you have, for example, too much vendor concentration or too much vendor risk. If you're overly dependent on one vendor for a critical raw material, that's a risk. Are there other vendors out there you should be looking at? What is plan B, plan C, in case vendor A goes out of business, can't fulfill demand or raises their prices unexpectedly? We want to know that we've got a clearer view of our vendor management, our supplier management, and also a good understanding of who's delivering us the highest quality, best cost and in the most timely fashion. We need to understand, evaluate and measure all the different suppliers throughout the supply chain and analyze those risks. There are also some other areas you want to examine: For example, what's the geopolitical risk of having a vendor in certain parts of the world?\n\nPrioritizing supply chain risks Your supply chain might have a number of issues. How do you decide what to prioritize and tackle? Kimberling: It's important to rethink what your prioritization criteria are. Up until 2020, I would say most supply chain managers were focused on, 'How do we optimize cost?' and 'How do we optimize throughput?' That is the traditional way of thinking about supply chains. Now you have to add another layer of complexity: What about the long-term sustainability and the overall flexibility for the supply chain? How do we adapt quickly if there's a disruption? We might have to look at higher costs in the name of having more predictable risk mitigation efforts in place. In the past, you would just say, 'Let's look at where the biggest cost savings could be if we were to adapt or adjust something within our supply chain.' Now, mindsets have shifted about the best approach to supply chain risk management. You have to look at the overall reliability of the supply chain. Today's supply chain risk management is a matter of defining what your key prioritization criteria are and identifying -- based on those criteria -- where the biggest risks are. Risk exists at all stages of the supply chain. That's why organizations need proactive mitigation efforts.",
    "Software Supply Chain Security Turns to Risk Mitigation\n\n\n\nBy Chris Hughes\n\niStock photo\n\n2021 was a wild year for cybersecurity, memorable for a slew of data breaches, including cloud provider outages, ransomware attacks and software supply chain compromises.\n\nThe software supply chain has become a notable concern due to the explosive growth of open source software use and the cascading impact of software supply chain incidents, whether from open source software or vendor proprietary software.\n\nThe SolarWinds compromise and the Log4j panic, two high-profile software supply chain incidents, garnered the most headlines as organizations associated with these attacks scrambled to address their impact.\n\nThe attacks on the software supply chain keep coming. In its \u201c2021 State of the Software Supply Chain\u201d report, security provider Sonatype recorded 12,000 incidents this past year, a 650 percent increase over the previous year. Despite this surge, supply chain compromises are not new: the Cloud Native Computing Foundation has documented a repository of notable supply chain attacks dating back to 2003.\n\nSupply chain attacks are not limited to the private sector. They also affect the public sector and federal agencies, including the Defense Department and its industry partners, who are some of the biggest consumers of proprietary and open source software.\n\nCountless organizations \u2014 including in the federal community \u2014 continue to adopt open source software for its myriad benefits, such as expediting timelines, providing readily available code, improving functionality and offering transparency.\n\nSonatype in the report noted 73 percent year-over-year growth in development downloads of open source components. Unfortunately, open source developers may not be dedicating enough time to securing their code. According to the Linux Foundation\u2019s \u201cReport on the 2020 FOSS Contributor Survey,\u201d the average amount of time an open source developer spends on securing code is less than 3 percent.\n\nThe benefits of open source software adoption come with risks. Nowhere is this more apparent than with the Log4j security incident, which included the identification of a vulnerability in Log4j, an open source Apache logging framework. The incident left thousands of organizations worldwide, including many federal agencies in the United States, scrambling to determine if they were directly using the vulnerable version of Log4j and whether the vendor software they consume was also impacted. The latter fear was accompanied by a barrage of vendor advisories and bulletins.\n\nThe SolarWinds cyberattack highlighted the potential for malicious actors to compromise a vendor\u2019s build environment and insert malicious software that could then be distributed broadly across the ecosystem.\n\nIn late 2020, as the fallout from the SolarWinds cyberattack escalated, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency released a set of emergency directives documenting mitigations that federal agencies should take to avoid the exploitation of their systems using SolarWinds.\n\nBuilding on this incident and others, the cybersecurity executive order highlighted the need for guidance around validating vendors\u2019 secure software development environments and practices, as well as instruction for monitoring and reporting cybersecurity incidents.\n\nThe Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency also created a dedicated page in its emergency directives for Log4j vulnerability guidance. CISA\u2019s guidance applied to both vendors using the component in their software and affected organizations using it internally or through vendor software consumption.\n\nThis event also highlighted an alarming reality: most organizations lack effective methods to identify the software and associated components they are using.\n\nPalo Alto\u2019s Cloud Threat Research Group also released research highlighting software supply chain concerns, noting that supply chain flaws are difficult to detect and that third-party costs pose hidden risk. It pointed out several relevant software supply chain attacks. Its report laid out how attackers are poisoning continuous integration pipelines and causing cascading impacts on downstream software consumers.\n\nIt also highlighted concerns associated with infrastructure-as-code and container templates, which are increasingly being used by organizations in support of pushes for cloud adoption and digital transformation initiatives.\n\nThe software supply chain, from both proprietary and open source perspectives, is fragile and warrants more security rigor, yet most organizations aren\u2019t quite sure where to begin.\n\nThankfully, public and private organizations are releasing guidelines and best practices that companies can leverage to improve their software supply chain security hygiene and mitigate risk to their organizations and customers.\n\nThe National Institute of Standards and Technology, for example, released Cybersecurity Supply Chain Risk Management Practices, or 800-161, a framework to evaluate supply chain security. It was updated in October in draft form and is now undergoing comment reviews.\n\nAppendix F of this document responds specifically to the cybersecurity executive order and strives to provide guidelines for enhancing software supply chain security.\n\nNIST recommends that federal agencies \u2014 and the private sector, as well \u2014 incorporate C-SCRM practices into key activities such as enterprise-wide risk management and acquisition. NIST also defines \u201ccritical software\u201d and provides associated security measures. The document offers guidelines for software verification to help developers supply secure products and services to organizations within the federal government.\n\nThese recommendations address critical activities such as threat modeling, static and dynamic application scanning, and the identification of hard-coded secrets, all of which can locate vulnerabilities and risks that may impact software consumers.\n\nGenerally, the NIST guidelines recommend that federal agencies ensure these practices be performed by their software suppliers. That will include baking these requirements into acquisition language in the future.\n\nThe 800-161 recommendations also carry language associated with emerging software supply chain concepts, notably the often talked about concept of a \u201csoftware bill of materials,\u201d which acts as a method of increased transparency and provenance to help organizations identify what software they are consuming, where it exists and, potentially, the vulnerabilities associated with it. These recommendations have been championed by the National Telecommunications and Information Administration and CISA, each releasing best practices. Think back to the Log4j vulnerability. A poor software asset inventory meant many organizations were left scrambling to even identify if they were impacted.\n\nShifting attention to open source software, 800-161 includes sections dedicated to open source software controls, with an eye on varying levels of maturity such as \u201cfoundational, sustaining and enhancing.\u201d These cover a range of issues, from controls such as software composition analysis to binary software composition analysis to setting up a centralized repository of open source components that have been catalogued and approved for organizational use.\n\nOn the industry side, Cloud Native Computing Foundation\u2019s white paper, \u201cBest Practices for Supply Chain Security,\u201d outlines four principles for supply chain security: trust, automation, clarity and mutual authentication. Each of these categories is critical at every step of the supply chain ecosystem to ensure a resilient software supply chain and mitigate many of the incidents we\u2019ve seen.\n\nWhat makes the guidance unique is the distinctions it makes among assurance requirements. It notes that not all software and enterprises share the same security requirements and risk tolerances, and it identifies low-, moderate- and high-assurance products/environments. Like the NIST guidance, the white paper recognizes that best practices carry different decisions and activities depending on whether the users are software producers or consumers.\n\nThese practices help producers ensure they provide a product that matches their customers\u2019 requirements. And they help software consumers ensure vendors are offering them software aligned with their risk tolerance. While the Cloud Native Computing Foundation guidance provides specific actions at various stages of the software supply chain, it carries some overlap with NIST guidance, such as requiring a software bill of material from third-party suppliers, utilizing trusted repositories, and performing security control assessment on ingested software.\n\nSo, what\u2019s next?\n\nSoftware supply chain concerns are here to stay. Organizations are realizing just how brittle their software supply chain security practices are; and malicious actors take advantage of this reality.\n\nThe federal government and defense community have made clear statements highlighting how critical software is to national security and international competitiveness.\n\nSoftware brings innovations and promise, but it comes with an exorbitant amount of relevant peril, particularly when fundamental security practices and processes are not implemented throughout the software supply chain.\n\nThis is a reality for both software producers and consumers across all industries and verticals. The implementation of secure software supply chain practices across the industry is no easy feat. However, the new guidance from NIST, the Cloud Native Computing Foundation and other security watchers is a great step toward what should be a strategic imperative for our national security and for a well-functioning society in today\u2019s digital world.\n\n\n\nChris Hughes is an adjunct professor in the School of Cybersecurity and Information Technology at the University of Maryland Global Campus.\n\nTopics: Cybersecurity",
    "Major disruptions to global supply chains have been unrelenting since the earliest days of the COVID-19 crisis. Now with a raging war in Ukraine and economic sanctions against Russia, global trade is in further disarray. Companies across all industries are feeling pressure to reevaluate their supply chain vulnerabilities and strategies - and it\u2019s not just the big companies that need to take action.\n\nSmall and mid-sized companies should be equally concerned about these disruptions - or even more so as they often do not have the margins to offset significant slowdowns in their businesses and might be less agile in responding to increased customer demands and shifts in the regulatory, economic, and technology landscapes. Here, we take a step back from the overwhelming global geopolitical crises unfolding to explore five practical ways for mid-sized businesses to build supply chain resiliency with risk management practices.\n\nThink broadly about your supply chain\n\nFirst, let\u2019s define it. A supply chain is the network of individuals, companies, resources (knowledge, public utilities, materials, services, etc.), processes, and technologies used to make and sell a product or service. The broad stroke of this definition offers a comprehensive approach to help build a matrix that enhances visibility into your supply chain. As a first step, business leaders must create an exhaustive list of suppliers for each category, then prioritize your providers relative to your dependency level and the materiality of a disruptive event. Next, expand the matrix by beginning the risk management process - identifying your risks and assessing them in terms of frequency and severity of impact.\n\nHere are two examples of how to approach risk identification and assessment:\n\nConsider talent supply chain risks by examining the resources and methods used by your organization to attract, hire, engage, and retain talent and manage succession for executive roles. Quantify the likelihood and severity of experiencing higher than normal resignations, wage inflation, unionized workforces, recruitment costs, and the sharp rise in demand for wellness benefits and programs over the next 12 months.\n\nConsider a materials supply chain risk by examining critical materials dependencies both upstream and downstream. Quantify the value of those supplier relationships and the impact on customers and internal teams in the event of disruption. Consider alternative sources for the kind and quality of goods or services that each provides. You should also assess your organization\u2019s rank and standing with key suppliers and be intentional about fortifying your agreements and purchasing strategies. Every supplier has its top and preferred customers list, but is your business on your suppliers\u2019 lists? Large supply distribution companies generally offer volume-based pricing or preferred purchasing programs and for some, in the time of crisis, that can result in prioritized purchasing ability and delivery. Your mid-sized business could be a big deal to a supplier on a local or regional basis so it\u2019s important to take action to improve your status before a crisis event or disruption occurs.\n\nImprove supplier auditing\n\nAfter identifying and prioritizing critical suppliers, consider adding meaningful contract provisions and auditing processes to key contracts. There are many options for supplier auditing platforms or you can develop your own questionnaires and methods. Here are a few sample questions you might ask in an audit:\n\nDoes your company have a documented supply chain strategy?\n\nDoes your supply chain strategy clearly support our engagement? How?\n\nIs your supply chain strategy supported by clear and understandable functional, team, and individual performance objectives? Please describe.\n\nHow do you notify customers of supply chain disruptions or shortages?\n\nAnother option is to contractually require suppliers to provide their business continuity and disaster recovery (BC/DR) plans and/or testing results annually. For integrated suppliers or those upon which you have significant dependencies, consider requiring bi-annual live BC/DR tabletop exercises using creative and relevant scenarios as a service level agreement.\n\nIncrease supplier diversity\n\nMany women, veteran, and minority-owned businesses were decimated by the pandemic when their supply chains slowed to a crawl or failed altogether and they couldn\u2019t keep pace with customer demand. However, following an infusion of small business grant and loan support by governments and record-breaking private funding, training, and infrastructure support, a strong class of diverse businesses has emerged. Diversifying your primary supplier base through targeted new relationships with these types of businesses enhances your corporate social responsibility profile, fills gaps and builds redundancies in critical areas, promotes innovation, and increases brand recognition among different demographics.\n\nClean up siloed tech suppliers\n\nTechnology is undoubtedly essential to supply chain management. While having multiple technology tools and platforms to support your operations is often necessary, acquiring tech in a silo can put organizations\u2019 logistics at risk. Well-established companies with highly segmented operations and fast-growing new companies alike that don\u2019t have centralized IT roadmaps, vetting, and approval processes often adopt tools and platforms without cross-checking their use cases or cross-functional impact. An IT inventory that examines the key features of third-party and homegrown legacy systems can reveal tech that is outdated or unnecessarily redundant that creates more pain points during system outages, cybersecurity attacks and breaches, and when tracking access to confidential information. IT strategic planning and discipline in tech acquisition are integral to risk mitigation as the growing trends of advanced automation, analytics, and digital supply chains continue. This is one area where business leaders must establish strong controls, streamline partners, and audit for security compliance and solvency.\n\nPut supply chain trends in the right context\n\nThere is no shortage of articles on emerging supply chain management trends, and still many could not have predicted today\u2019s geopolitical landscape with an invasion in Europe, spiking global oil prices, and the onslaught of ransomware attacks that are disrupting supply chains daily. It\u2019s important to remain practical and focused on controlling the right risks, in the right way, at the right time for your organization because you cannot address everything.\n\nTalk to your trusted advisors - insurance brokers, attorneys, and trade groups - about relevant trends that you need to prioritize for your business, and don\u2019t overlook your internal business leaders and teams. Oftentimes, internal matters are a driving force behind supply chain and business disruptions - from talent shortages, understaffed purchasing departments, improper financial forecasting, aging buildings and technology infrastructure, employee burnout, and more. Focus inward and strengthen collaboration between functional leaders to gain insights on the trends that are most impactful to your strategy.\n\nApplying risk identification and assessment methods can help you understand the gaps in your organization\u2019s supply chain management strategy and lead to comprehensive, well-informed actions plans. As you implement, monitor, and adjust those action plans based on experience and emerging risks, your mitigation practices will mature and lead to an improved state of risk control.\n\n\n\n",
    "A webinar on risk and resilience in the supply chain - co-hosted by supply chain specialist UST and BizClik Media Group - is now available to view on-demand.\n\nUntil the pandemic, value chains had been growing in length and complexity, as companies saw supply as a source of cost savings, mainly through cheap labour.\n\nAs a result, from the 1980s onwards there was a sizable shift in manufacturing and production away from the West and towards the East.\n\nBut the COVID-19 pandemic changed everything. Wave after wave of lockdowns - combined with stratospherically high levels of e-commerce - saw supply chains overheat. Congested ports and a chronic shortage of container capacity caused shipping costs to soar, and all of these problems are ongoing.\n\nThe pandemic also caused a societal factory reset, prompting people to re-evaluate what is important to them. This has resulted in the Great Resignation, and supply chains have been especially badly hit, because haulage and warehousing are two areas in which recruitment and labour retention have never been more challenging.\n\nNow there is war in Ukraine, which is disrupting the supply of energy, cereal crops and microprocessors and is sending us into an even steeper inflationary spiral.\n\nIn this webinar - presented by digital transformation solutions provider UST, and Supply Chain Digital - you will gain insights from industry experts into:\n\n\u25cf The role of IoT and big data\n\n\u25cf How to implement agile supply chains\n\n\u25cf Supply chain transparency\n\n\u25cf The full impact of COVID-19 on the supply chain, and the 'new normal'\n\nThe speakers are Jonathan Colehower , Global Supply Chain Strategy Practice Lead at UST, and David Loseby , a consultant with Aquitaine Strategy.\n\nColehower has deep supply chain expertise and extensive strategy consulting experience. For 20 years, he has focused on management consulting, with McKinsey and Accenture, and also has deep experience in application software.

    "Before a baby is ever born, critical supply chain problems with nutrition and oxygen can result in premature birth or even death and increase the child and mother's lifelong risk of cardiovascular disease.\n\nScientists have found that a midgestation increase in the hormone leptin, which most of us associate with appetite suppression, produces problematic blood vessel dysfunction and restriction of the baby's growth in preeclampsia that put mother and baby at risk.\n\nIt's known that about 20 weeks into a pregnancy, women with preeclampsia experience an increase in the production of leptin by the placenta but the consequences have been unknown.\n\n\"It's kind of emerging as a marker of preeclampsia,\" says Dr. Jessica Faulkner, vascular physiologist in the Department of Physiology at the Medical College of Georgia and corresponding author of the study in the journal Hypertension.\n\nLeptin, mostly produced by fat cells, is also produced by the temporary organ, the placenta, which enables the mom to supply her developing baby with nutrients and oxygen, Faulkner says. Leptin levels steadily increase in a healthy pregnancy, but specifically what leptin is doing even normally in this scenario is unclear. There is some evidence it's a natural nutrient sensor in reproduction or maybe a way to enable new blood vessel growth and/or to stimulate growth hormone for usual development.\n\n\"But in preeclamptic patients leptin levels go up more than they should,\" Faulkner says.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThe new research looking at the impact shows for the first time that the increase in leptin results in endothelial dysfunction in which blood vessels constrict, their ability to relax is impaired and the baby's growth is restricted.\n\nWhen the scientists inhibited the precursor for the powerful, natural blood vessel dilator nitric oxide, like what happens in hypertension, it pretty much replicates the effect of the midgestation leptin increase.\n\nTo make matters worse, the scientists also have evidence that leptin plays a role in increasing levels of the blood vessel constrictor endothelin 1.\n\nConversely when they deleted the receptor for aldosterone, in this case the mineralocorticoid receptors on the surface of the cells that line blood vessels, endothelial dysfunction didn't happen, says Dr. Eric Belin de Chantemele, physiologist in MCG's Vascular Biology Center and the paper's senior author.\n\n\"We think what is going on in preeclamptic patients is the placenta is not properly formed,\" Faulkner says. \"In the middle of gestation, fetal growth is not happening as it should. I think the placenta is compensating by increasing leptin production,\" potentially with the goal of helping spur more normal growth. But the results appear to be just the opposite.\n\nadvertisement\n\n\"It can hurt the baby's development and increase the risk of long-term health problems for the baby and mother,\" she says.\n\nWhile leptin has been associated with preeclampsia, this was the first study to show that when leptin goes up, it induces the unhealthy clinical characteristics of preeclampsia, Belin de Chantemele says.\n\nWhen they infused leptin in pregnant mice to mimic the surge that happens in preeclampsia, they saw an unhealthy chain reaction with the adrenal gland making more of the steroid hormone aldosterone which could be increasing the production of endothelin 1, also by the placenta.\n\nTheir previous work has shown that outside of pregnancy, an infusion of leptin results in endothelial dysfunction. Belin de Chantemele's lab has pioneered work showing that fat-derived leptin directly prompts the adrenal glands to make more aldosterone which activates mineralocorticoid receptors found throughout the body, notably in the blood vessels in females, which is important to blood pressure levels. High aldosterone levels are an obesity hallmark and a leading cause of metabolic and cardiovascular problems.\n\nThat work made them hypothesize that the infusion of leptin that occurs midgestation in preeclampsia had a similar impact that deletion of the mineralocorticoid receptors lining blood vessels could resolve. They have connected similar physiological dots in young females in whom obesity often robs the early years of protection from cardiovascular disease that being female typically provides until menopause.\n\nThese same players likely are factors in what increases the mother's lifetime risk of cardiovascular problems, Faulkner says.\n\n\"It means the system is dysregulated and that is basically when you develop disease,\" she says.\n\nTheir goals include better defining the pathways for increased blood pressure and other blood vessel dysfunction, pathways that can be targeted during pregnancy to prevent potentially devastating results for mother and baby, from what Faulkner characterizes as \"a two-hit condition.\"\n\nTheir findings to date indicate that effective therapies to better protect mother and baby could be existing drugs like eplerenone, a blood pressure medicine that binds to the mineralocorticoid receptor effectively reducing the effect of higher levels of aldosterone, the scientists say.\n\nThe problems likely start with the placenta, and potentially inadequate blood flow to the temporary organ early in its development and subsequent failure of the development of the big blood vessels that become the passageway for nutrients and oxygen from mother to baby.\n\nIt's known that in preeclampsia there are problems like decreased secretion of placental growth factor. The bottom lines appear to be that by midgestation, the placenta can no longer properly support the baby, which may be why it secretes leptin, possibly in an effort to spur its own growth and normal fetal development, but in reality it contributes to cardiovascular and fetal consequences, the scientists report, including raising the mother's blood pressure.\n\n\"Preeclampsia rates unfortunately are rising,\" Faulkner says, both in the number of pregnant women affected and in how severely they are affected. According to an analysis of data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published in January of this year in the Journal of the American Heart Association, rates of hypertension that arise during pregnancy, including preeclampsia and gestational hypertension, have nearly doubled in both rural and urban areas in this country from 2007-19 and have been accelerating since 2014. Gestational hypertension is an increase in a pregnant woman's blood midgestation but without associated signs of protein in the urine, a sign of kidney distress, or markers of placental dysfunction, as are found in preeclampsia.\n\nRisk factors include carrying more than one fetus, chronic high blood pressure, type 1 or 2 diabetes, kidney disease, autoimmune disorders before pregnancy as well as use of in vitro fertilization. Increasing rates of preeclampsia are primarily attributed to obesity, which is a risk factor for many of these conditions and associated with high levels of both aldosterone and leptin, Faulkner says. Other times, women seem to develop the problem spontaneously.\n\nNext steps in the research include better understanding how and why leptin goes up more than it should, Faulkner says.\n\nThe scientists are supported by the National Institutes of Health and the American Heart Association.",
    "The war in Europe, inflationary pressures, and the ongoing fallout from a global pandemic are all contributing to supply chain disruption across many industries. Insureds need a risk management partner who can meet their needs as a consultant, in addition to providing tailor-made coverage.\n\nSupply chain risk is not a new concept to underwriters or risk managers. But it\u2019s no exaggeration to say that the degree to which supply chain problems are now impairing the operations of businesses across many sectors is unprecedented in our lifetimes.\n\n\u201cI read the other day that something like 95% of Fortune 1,000 companies have reported significant disruption from supply chain right now. That\u2019s about as systemic as you can get,\u201d said Seth Hedrington, Senior Vice President, Major Accounts \u2013 Risk Management at Liberty Mutual.\n\nSupply chain issues affect not only the ability of businesses to receive vital materials, they also impede their ability to fulfill their contracts and deliver goods to their end customers.\n\n\u201cThe broader risk management concerns involve supply chain uncertainty, quality control, and contract liability. Talent risk is also a factor, given to what degree labor shortages are impacting manufacturing, construction, hospitality, retail and a host of other industries,\u201d said Heath Kidd, Vice President, Industry Solutions for Liberty Mutual. \u201cIt\u2019s really hard to overstate just how pervasive these issues are across industries and the risk landscape.\u201d\n\nDifferent causes, similar solutions\n\nThe reasons why we\u2019re seeing supply chain disruptions to this degree are many and varied and they overlap in some cases. But chief among them are an ongoing global pandemic, war in Ukraine, and the aforementioned labor shortages and inflationary pressures that are driving up the costs of materials for numerous industries.\n\nRegardless of the causes of supply chain disruptions, yesterday, today, or in the future, the approach to managing these risks holds true over time and across sectors.\n\n\u201cI think a lot of companies have been taken off guard with the severity of the supply chain issues they are facing and don\u2019t want to get burned again. Managing supply chain risk can and should be a proactive risk management decision. And it goes beyond insurance coverage. There are a lot of operational considerations that can help mitigate the risk significantly, and we\u2019re seeing many of our customers taking those steps,\u201d said Hedrington.\n\nThere will be those that take little action, and that is a legitimate choice, but they should understand that they\u2019re essentially self-insuring against that risk. It comes down to a business decision.\u201d he added.\n\nFour key mitigation measures to manage supply chain disruption\n\n1) Vet your extended supply chain. \u201cFirst and foremost, companies should be thinking about supply chain vetting,\u201d Hedrington explained. \u201cAnd in many cases, that can be a pretty long chain; longer or more complex than you might expect.\u201d He outlined that most companies have traditionally studied their key suppliers to gauge whether they can deliver vital goods and services when and where they say they can.\n\nBut he said it\u2019s not as common for companies to vet their secondary and tertiary suppliers.\n\n\u201cI think one of the key mitigation techniques is expanding your view of what the supply chain really is beyond those primary suppliers,\u201d Hedrington said.\n\nThat includes vetting suppliers, especially when onboarding new vendors to meet material shortfalls from existing vendors or seeking to diversify suppliers. Businesses might also want to consider ensuring that supply chain partners include the business as an additional insured on general liability policies, Kidd said.\n\nCommunication with the insurers and brokers of suppliers at every tier should be open and as frequent as possible to make sure that all stakeholders are responding to this increased supply chain risk and managing their operations accordingly, he added.\n\n2) Reassess your business continuity plan. A second key factor, Hedrington said, is maintaining an up-to-date and quality control-focused business continuity plan.\n\n\u201cDoes your business continuity plan include where you will source key materials if a primary supplier dries up?\u201d is a question Hedrington posed.\n\nHe also explained that many companies may be considering material substitutions to adapt to shortages, but that this can carry unaccounted for risks.\n\nMany of us remember the notable substitution of Chinese drywall after the American made drywall supply ran out due to the rebuilding demand after several severe hurricanes hit the Southeast. The Chinese drywall that was used to build thousands of homes there between 2002 and 2007 was found to be defective, causing health issues and property damage.\n\n\u201cMake sure you proactively have and maintain relationships so you can go to a secondary, even a third source as needed,\u201d Hedrington said.\n\nKidd noted that product liability and product defect claims can have serious consequences and long tails.\n\nBeyond taking all the preventive measures to ensure the quality of materials, that also means developing plans to respond to situations where a substituted material isn\u2019t up to snuff and anticipating how to manage the fallout.\n\nAnalyzing to what degree labor shortages could impact quality is also something to keep in mind given the challenges many businesses are facing in finding skilled workers and keeping their operations fully staffed.\n\n3) Re-evaluate inventory management. A third mitigation technique, and one that represents a significant change in how companies operate their businesses, is inventory management.\n\nThere was a time in the not-too-distant past that just-in-time delivery was all the rage in manufacturing, retail, and other sectors. The logic was that companies could save money by ordering and receiving the products they needed within a predictable target date, forestalling the need to tie up capital in extensive inventory levels. But it has left a lot of businesses empty handed amidst the recent challenges to the supply chain.\n\n\u201cHealthcare and the crisis of PPE, even ventilators, in the early days of the pandemic are examples of this vulnerability,\u201d said Kidd. \u201cMany, probably most, hospitals didn\u2019t have enough protective equipment available during the first surges of the virus. Because of the lead times and supply chain issues, you just couldn\u2019t get them. A lot of them are rethinking that.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow the same thing is happening across all sorts of industries, and that applies to raw materials, as well as parts and equipment. Many businesses are trying to offset this risk by keeping more items on hand. But this introduces some other risks that insureds may not be thinking about.\u201d\n\nFor example, as inventory levels rise many businesses are faced with warehousing constraints. It\u2019s important to consider other related issues, like scaling property coverages to match what\u2019s on-hand, as well as maintaining up-to-date appraisals to ensure coverage is adequate.\n\n4) Proactively manage contracts. A fourth technique is contract vigilance and flexibility. Widespread supply chain disruption means that many companies are at risk of not being able to deliver goods and services at the price level and delivery date they promised.\n\n\u201cA lot of companies right now are scrambling because they\u2019re potentially facing breach of contract issues,\u201d Hedrington said.\n\nTheir contracts weren\u2019t flexible enough so that if they came up against adverse conditions, they\u2019d have some wiggle room.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re having them proactively look at that as another non-insurance technique as well,\u201d Hedrington said.\n\nThis should include a sober assessment of a company\u2019s ability to complete projects on time, within contract specifications, and on budget. Breach of contract or financial performance issues can result in professional liability claims. It\u2019s important to continually assess the adequacy of coverage and adapt to reflect the changing environment, even with the knowledge that these types of claims tend to have long tails, so the true impact may not be seen for some time to come.\n\nA productive partnership\n\nWhether it be a need for supply chain vetting, strengthening a business continuity plan, identifying alternate suppliers, or analyzing the suitability of customer contracts, Liberty Mutual is working with customers and brokers to help see them through this period of disruption, they said.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s at times like this that you come to really appreciate those collaborative partnerships. Maybe the whole lesson of all this is just how interconnected business is today. No one is going to be able to get through this alone. That applies to insurance and is why it\u2019s so important to have a team that can bring the best insights to those planning conversations and offer the risk control guidance that can help minimize some of these impacts in the future,\u201d said Kidd.\n\n\u201cWhere we differentiate ourselves, beyond the products and services we offer, is that we meet clients where they are from a risk perspective and truly help them fill in the gaps,\u201d Hedrington said. \u201cWe are partners in all areas of risk management, not just the product [insurance coverage] side of things,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cWe incorporate feedback based on what we\u2019re seeing, what the claims data is telling us, and what our customers are experiencing in the market and then respond to that with industry insights, trends \u2014 observations that then allow us to inform a better process going forward,\u201d Kidd said.\n\n\u201cI think that\u2019s what sets Liberty apart. And I think that allows us to be in tune with what our customers need and be responsive to the demands in the marketplace.\u201d\n\nTo learn more, please visit https://www.business.libertymutual.com/.\n\nThis article was produced by the R&I Brand Studio, a unit of the advertising department of Risk & Insurance, in collaboration with Liberty Mutual Insurance.

    "In May 2020, much of the world was still in the grip of the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Lockdowns, shelter-in-place orders, and travel restrictions were disrupting activity in every part of the economy. Demand evaporated in some categories and skyrocketed in others. As they struggled to keep their businesses running, companies were planning significant strategic changes to the configuration and operation of their supply chains. When we surveyed senior supply-chain executives from across industries and geographies, 93 percent of respondents told us that they intended to make their supply chains far more flexible, agile, and resilient.\n\nTwelve months later, in the second quarter of 2021, we repeated our survey with a similarly diverse group of supply-chain leaders. This time, we asked respondents to describe the steps they had taken to shore up their supply chains over the past year, how those changes compared with the plans they drew up earlier in the crisis, and how they expect their supply chains to further evolve in the coming months and years.\n\nIt\u2019s quicker to build inventories than factories\n\nIn our 2020 survey, just over three-quarters of respondents told us they planned to improve resilience through physical changes to their supply-chain footprints. By this year, an overwhelming majority (92 percent) said that they had done so.\n\nBut our survey revealed significant shifts in footprint strategy. Last year, most companies planned to pull multiple levers in their efforts to improve supply-chain resilience, combining increases in the inventory of critical products, components, and materials with efforts to diversify supply bases while localizing or regionalizing supply and production networks. In practice, companies were much more likely than expected to increase inventories, and much less likely either to diversify supply bases (with raw-material supply being a notable exception) or to implement nearshoring or regionalization strategies (Exhibit 1).\n\nExhibit 1 We strive to provide individuals with disabilities equal access to our website. If you would like information about this content we will be happy to work with you. Please email us at: McKinsey_Website_Accessibility@mckinsey.com\n\nDifferent industries have responded to the resilience challenge in markedly different ways. Healthcare players stand out as resilience leaders. They applied the broadest range of measures, with 60 percent of healthcare respondents saying they had regionalized their supply chains and 33 percent having moved production closer to end markets. By contrast, only 22 percent of automotive, aerospace, and defense players had regionalized production, even though more than three-quarters of them prioritized this approach in their answers to the 2020 survey. Chemicals and commodity players made the smallest overall changes to their supply-chain footprints during the past year.\n\nSome of these differences among sectors can be attributed to the structural characteristics of the industries involved: for example, chemicals and metals are asset-intensive sectors with large, expensive production sites. Investments in new capacity can take years to complete. Other respondents told us that they had struggled to find suitable suppliers to support their localization or near-shoring plans.\n\nDespite these challenges, regionalization remains a priority for most companies. Almost 90 percent of respondents told us that they expect to pursue some degree of regionalization during the next three years, and 100 percent of respondents from both the healthcare and the engineering, construction, and infrastructure sectors said the approach was relevant to their sector.\n\nAlmost 90 percent of respondents told us that they expect to pursue some degree of regionalization during the next three years.\n\nRisk management: More breadth, not enough depth\n\nThe pandemic pushed risk to the top of virtually every corporate agenda. For the first time, most respondents (95 percent) say they have formal supply-chain risk-management processes. A further 59 percent of companies say they have adopted new supply-chain risk management-practices over the past 12 months. A small minority (4 percent) set up a new risk-management function from scratch, but most respondents say they have strengthened existing capabilities.\n\nWould you like to learn more about our Operations Practice\n\nThe actions taken by companies varied according to the precrisis maturity of their supply-chain risk-management capabilities. Companies with little or no risk-management experience tended to invest in new software tools, while higher-maturity organizations mainly focused on the implementation of new practices.\n\nThe proactive monitoring of supplier risks was the primary focus of these efforts, yet significant blind spots remain in most companies\u2019 supply-chain risk-management setups. Just under half of the companies in our survey say they understand the location of their tier-one suppliers and the key risks those suppliers face. But only 2 percent can make the same claim about suppliers in the third tier and beyond. That matters because many of today\u2019s most pressing supply shortages, such as semiconductors, happen in these deeper supply-chain tiers (Exhibit 2).\n\nExhibit 2 We strive to provide individuals with disabilities equal access to our website. If you would like information about this content we will be happy to work with you. Please email us at: McKinsey_Website_Accessibility@mckinsey.com\n\nSupply-chain planning: A test for technology and organization\n\nThe transition to remote working was one of the most immediate and pronounced effects of pandemic-era restrictions on mobility and access to workplaces. Broadly, respondents to our survey believe they managed that transition well, with 58 percent reporting good supply-chain-planning performance over the past year. The remaining 42 percent of respondents told us that remote working had led to delays in supply-chain decision making.\n\nThe success of an organization\u2019s planning was strongly linked to its use of modern digital tools, especially advanced analytics. Compared with organizations that reported problems, successful companies were 2.5 times more likely to report they had preexisting advanced-analytics capabilities. Of the companies that had difficulties managing their supply chains during the crisis, 71 percent say they are ramping up their use of advanced analytics.\n\nThe benefits of advanced analytics in supply-chain management are now being recognized across industries. With the sole exception of the healthcare sector, more than 50 percent of respondents in every industry say they have implemented additional analytics approaches during the past 12 months (Exhibit 3). The biggest shifts occurred in industries that were the lowest users of these approaches before the pandemic. In commodities, for example, 75 percent of companies are currently increasing their use, with the remaining 25 percent saying they plan to do so in the future. The only sector in which the race to adopt advanced analytics techniques shows signs of slowing down is in advanced electronics and high tech, where their adoption is already very high.\n\nExhibit 3 We strive to provide individuals with disabilities equal access to our website. If you would like information about this content we will be happy to work with you. Please email us at: McKinsey_Website_Accessibility@mckinsey.com\n\nDigitization surges but could tail off\n\nWith so much interest in advanced analytics, it comes as little surprise that the crisis has been a catalyst for further digitization of end-to-end supply-chain processes. An overwhelming majority of survey respondents say they have invested in digital supply-chain technologies during the past year, with most investing more than they originally planned. While automotive and commodity players were reluctant to commit to additional investments amid the uncertainty of early 2020, for example, 100 percent of the respondents in those sectors eventually did so (Exhibit 4). Almost every company also plans for further digital investment in the future. Construction is the only sector in which respondents say they are less likely to invest in digital supply chain technologies in the coming years.\n\nExhibit 4 We strive to provide individuals with disabilities equal access to our website. If you would like information about this content we will be happy to work with you. Please email us at: McKinsey_Website_Accessibility@mckinsey.com\n\nToday\u2019s ongoing and planned digitization efforts are most likely to focus on visibility, as companies strive for a better picture of their supply chains\u2019 real-time performance. For example, since May 2020, 30 percent of respondents had implemented new digital performance-management systems\u2014an important enabler of supply-chain visibility. Improved planning tools, either for specific aspects of the supply chain (such as logistics management) or broader end-to-end planning systems, come a close second among the companies in our survey, with more than three-quarters saying they were a priority. Just under half of all respondents also say they are looking at network-modeling tools to help them improve supply-chain design in the longer term. Nevertheless, despite the prevalence and impact of supply-chain shocks over the past two years, only 39 percent of companies are investing in tools to monitor risks and disruptions (Exhibit 5).\n\nExhibit 5 We strive to provide individuals with disabilities equal access to our website. If you would like information about this content we will be happy to work with you. Please email us at: McKinsey_Website_Accessibility@mckinsey.com\n\nTalent remains a major barrier to accelerated digitization, however, and the skills gap is widening. In our 2020 survey, only 10 percent of companies said they had sufficient in-house digital talent. And by this year, that figure had dropped dramatically, to only 1 percent (Exhibit 6). Respondents report a range of ongoing actions to address the digital-skills gap, including reskilling (55 percent) or redeploying (30 percent) existing staff, hiring new talent from the labor market (52 percent), and taking on specialist contract staff for specific projects (21 percent).\n\n\n\nExhibit 6 We strive to provide individuals with disabilities equal access to our website.

Please email us at: McKinsey_Website_Accessibility@mckinsey.com\n\nNext steps: Supply chains at an inflection point\n\nThe COVID-19 crisis put supply chains into the spotlight. Over the past year, supply-chain leaders have taken decisive action in response to the challenges of the pandemic: adapting effectively to new ways of working, boosting inventories, and ramping their digital and risk-management capabilities. Yet despite that progress, other recent events have shown that supply chains remain vulnerable to shocks and disruptions, with many sectors currently wrestling to overcome supply-side shortages and logistics-capacity constraints. Most worryingly, these new problems are emerging just as senior leaders are turning their attention away from supply-chain issues. In many sectors, there are signs that the rate of investment in digital supply-chain technologies is slowing down. Talent gaps are wider than ever, end-to-end transparency remains elusive, and progress toward more localized, flexible supply-chain structures has been slower than anticipated.\n\nThe coming months could turn out to be critical for supply-chain leaders. Some companies will build upon the momentum they gained during the pandemic, with decisive action to adapt their supply-chain footprint, modernize their technologies, and build their capabilities. Others may slip back, reverting to old ways of working that leave them struggling to compete with their more agile competitors on cost or service, and still vulnerable to shocks and disruptions.",

    "NEWS | For Immediate Release\n\nNEW YORK, Mar 4, 2022 \u2013 Moody\u2019s Analytics announces the launch of Supply Chain Catalyst, a data and analytics platform for monitoring and managing supply chain risk. The solution helps organizations identify structural vulnerabilities and anticipate potential disruptions across their supply chain by providing a 360-degree view of suppliers across financial, sustainability, reputational and operational risk factors.\n\n\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has exposed the fragility of global supply chains, which are still in a state of disrepair. Recent events related to the Omicron variant and the military conflict between Russia and Ukraine have created further bottlenecks in both production and logistics. Tim Uy, Economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics notes, \u201cThere are significant downside risks to the near-term outlook for global supply chains, and while companies are increasingly building resiliency through adequate inventory and alternative sourcing, they should be prepared for headwinds.\u201d\n\n\n\nAs supply chains and distribution networks become more complex, it becomes harder to identify financial and reputational exposures. Reacting to evidence of vulnerabilities is also fraught as organizations need to find alternative providers quickly to minimize business disruptions. This rapid substitution often exposes a supply chain to the risk of new suppliers with dubious credentials or high-risk profiles.\n\n\n\nSupply Chain Catalyst is a second-generation solution, integrating risk data on over 400 million entities globally from the award-winning Orbis database, with industry-leading risk assessment capabilities, which have long been valued by Moody\u2019s customers. The combination enables a multi-faceted, robust, and efficient supplier screening and monitoring process so organizations can make data-driven procurement transformation decisions.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe designed Supply Chain Catalyst to help clients gain a holistic understanding of their suppliers\u2019 risk profile, build resiliency, anticipate shocks and minimize disruptions across their supply chain,\u201d said Carolina Azar, Senior Director at Moody\u2019s Analytics. \u201cWe are particularly proud that Supply Chain Catalyst also informs our customers\u2019 responsible sourcing and sustainability strategies, supporting both local and global communities.\u201d\n\n\n\nUsers of Supply Chain Catalyst can identify suppliers with weakening financial, sustainability, reputational and operational risk profiles for risk mitigation. Users can monitor these specific supply chain risk factors \u2013 as well as enterprise-wide risk \u2013 by combining their own knowledge of suppliers with our data and robust risk analytics, including Moody\u2019s Environmental, Social and Governance scores and assessments.\n\nAbout Moody\u2019s Analytics\n\nMoody\u2019s Analytics provides financial intelligence and analytical tools to help business leaders make better, faster decisions.

    "Supply chain managers have always had to live with risk but in today's world, the only certainty seems to be uncertainty. Managing, and predicting, risks to supply chain has never been more important. So here are 10 risk-management strategies to consider - with one proviso. You can have the greatest strategy and the greatest technology but without the right investment in people development none of it will yield the benefits you seek. Invest as heavily in talent as you do in the tools to support them in their roles.\n\n10. Harmonise systems\n\nThe use of identical technology throughout your network allows for better communication between systems, and this mitigates against risk. Cloud-based solutions make this far easier than it once was, and this also reduces the inefficiency of siloed data.\n\n9. Improve supplier visibility\n\nWhat if a supplier goes bust? This can cause huge disruption. Greater visibility into your suppliers\u2019 financial stability helps with selecting reliable, stable supply partners. Certain credit-rating agencies offer predictive financial reporting on thousands of potential suppliers. This can help you develop more-secure business relationships.\n\n8. Track freight metrics\n\nRegardless of where you are in the supply chain, it\u2019s important you partner with a freight carrier that can deliver consistent results. Not every carrier is up to the challenge. When evaluating new freight carriers - or re-evaluating current ones - analyse their freight metrics first.\n\n7. Use supply chain software\n\nThere\u2019s no way to remove environmental risk in your supply chain - such as extreme weather and geo-physical events - but you can plan for them. Supply chain software helps with this by providing greater visibility, allowing you to identify vulnerable supply points, and to use data-driven insights to strengthen these areas.\n\n6. Reshore and nearshore\n\nReduce the scope of supply and you reduce the risk. In the face on ongoing chip shortages, Samsung is reshoring the production of microchips, and will make them in the US for this very reason. Nearshoring supply, by moving it to nearby regional suppliers, can be more expensive but this too reduces the potential risks of disruption.\n\n5. Use inventory buffers\n\nIt\u2019s an added expense, but at times of new product launches, and moves into new vertical markets, there\u2019s an opportunity to create an inventory buffer, as insurance against further manufacturing disruption from labour shortages or seasonal disruption, from weather, typically.\n\n4. Tighten Cybersecurity\n\nSupply chains are a back door into a company systems because organisations can\u2019t control the security measures taken by supply chain partners. Cybercriminals are increasingly attacking companies by first infiltrating third-party vendors. Counter this through compliance standards for all third-party vendors, including manufacturers, suppliers, and distributors. And provide comprehensive training for employees about cybersecurity protocols.\n\n3. Logistics planning\n\nImplement a logistics contingency plan, which is similar to an emergency response plan. The pandemic has shown the importance of this. Identify areas most vulnerable to political, geographic and economic risk. Diversify your supplier network so you aren\u2019t reliant on a single supplier, and establish a crisis response team to take critical decisions in the event of an emergency.\n\n2. Use big data\n\nBig Data has opened up a world of opportunities for self-protection, including using predictive analytics to model risk-event scenarios. By using data to forecast what might potentially happen during a worst-case situation, you can develop contingency plans that will prepare you for when disaster strikes. It\u2019s important to consolidate data for easy access. invest in a solution that keeps data in a single well-organised repository. Using siloed is like trying to view the horizon through a letter box.\n\n1. Use the risk-management model\n\nThe PPRR risk management model is a standard supply chain risk management strategy. The Ps stand for Prevention (precautionary action), Preparedness (contingency plans) Response (execute plans) and Recovery (resume operations).\n\n",
    "Military rad-hard design activity robust despite supply-chain headaches\n\nStory\n\nJohn McHale Editorial Director Military Embedded Systems\n\nMilitary funding \u2013 not only for traditional long-life missions but also for nontraditional shorter life, lower-cost small satellite applications \u2013 continues to grow. Radiation-hardened component designers are working to meet the reduced size, weight, power, and cost (SWaP-C) demands of these new missions while maintaining radiation tolerance and dealing with the supply-chain headaches that continue to plague the electronics industry.\n\nRobust growth in the radiation-hardened (rad-hard) component arena is due in part to the growing adversarial threat in space from nations like China, which motivates more funding from the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD). Mounting demand can also be ascribed to the success of lower-cost New Space applications like small satellites (small sats) and Low Earth Orbit (LEO) megaconstellations or satellite swarms.\n\nEvidence of that motivation is seen the Air Force Fiscal Year 2023 DoD budget request, which provides increased funding for the Space Force. Examples of that investment, according to the Air Force, are the funding request for $987 million for space technology development and prototyping missile warning/tracking as well as the $1 billion requested for ground and space segments of the Next-Generation Overhead Persistent Infrared (OPIR) missile-warning system.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing stable activity with business growing in the military market. Previewing the DoD budgets, we see those and what\u2019s requested and it\u2019s steady looking forward,\u201d says Bob Campanini, Vice President of Optoelectronics, for Micropac (Dallas, Texas).\n\nThe DoD funding commitments and market pressures are affecting the growth in rad-hard designs.\n\n\u201cWe are seeing a very diverse and interesting market for radiation-hardened and radiation-tolerant components and systems today,\u201d says Ken O\u2019Neill, Associate Director, Space and Aviation Marketing, Microchip Technology (San Jose, California). \u201cEvery segment of the market is very active at the moment. There seem to be many different factors at play. U.S. and international funding for human spaceflight, increasingly ambitious robotic and autonomous missions, elevated priority on defense early-warning and communications systems, and commercial ventures offering earth observation and communications services are all factors in today\u2019s buoyant space market.\u201d\n\n\u201cDesigns are constantly churning. The increased U.S. investment in military space is driving growth in classified and unclassified applications. The small sat business is growing even faster,\u201d says Anton Quiroz, President of Apogee Semi\u00adconductor (Plano, Texas).\n\nManned missions are also getting funding dollars. \u201cA lot of attention is going to shorter mission length in certain orbits but there are other longer, manned missions that have driven a lot of testing,\u201d Campanini says. \u201cThe architectural approach of having multiple instances of the same satellite drive an attractive volume production for constellations. Of course, the radiation exposure to devices and signal paths does depend upon the intended orbit, potential shielding from the physical build decisions, choice in radiation tolerant device materials. Materials such as fiber optic signal paths seen great supplier advances in radiation tolerance and are inherently resilient to electric and magnetic fields.\u201d\n\nLong-life classified missions are still critical to the U.S. military, but there is increasing demand for shorter-life systems that are low-cost and high-performance that can be deployed more quickly than a traditional military-satellite mission.\n\n\u201cWhen electronics is involved, the \u2019hottest application\u2018 is always the highest volume application and currently that is the (small sat) LEO constellations,\u201d Campanini says. \u201cSeveral of these end applications drive the same/similar demands for electronics. LEO small sats and manned space flight have similar radiation needs (minimal radiation requirements if humans are also present). Manned missions drive other requirements related to redundancy, fault tolerance, and fail safe.\u201d\n\n\u201cMilitary systems are exploring the trade-space encompassing mission success, \u00adprocurement cost, and time to launch,\u201d O\u2019Neill says. \u201cTraditional systems had high mission success, but were expensive and took a long time to build, test, and launch. While traditional systems are still under development, there are also military systems in development which seek novel ways to reduce cost and development time without sacrificing mission success.\u201d (Figure 1.)\n\n[Figure 1 | Microchip\u2019s portfolio of radiation-hardened and radiation-tolerant solutions includes high performance FPGAs [field-programmable gate arrays], mixed-signal ICs, isolated DC-DC converter modules, custom power supplies, hybrid solutions, MOSFETS, and more.]\n\nSupply-chain shortages\n\nThe only obstacle seemingly slowing this rapid growth is the supply-chain shortage plaguing the entire globe. Orders for components are coming in, but delivery delays abound for all types of parts.\n\n\u201cThe supply-chain shortage is still haunting the industry,\u201d Quiroz notes. \u201cWe still see quotes with 52-week lead times for certain components. Due to this crisis, we see military customs demanding systems be made in the U.S., with DoD investing more in long-term onshore semiconductor manufacturing. Building this infrastructure in the U.S will take time, but it will help and it\u2019s better late than never. The tensions between China and Taiwan are still an issue and a risk factor with an unknown result in the long term, so this investment is necessary. From our perspective, we manage our inventory, maintaining IC components in stock for key contracts.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not just semiconductors that are on back order, but electronics components of every type.\n\n\u201cThe delays have expanded to all materials, ICs, passive components, mechanical connectors, and more,\u201d Campanini says. \u201cIt will take a comprehensive approach to overcome these challenges to the military supply chain. Micropac is part of the Defense Microelectronics Cross Function Team, among other consortia, working to overcome challenges to the warfighter. The microelectronics offshore challenge was not created in a year and it will take more than a year to solve. So yes, there will be a risk exposure for a few more years.\n\n\u201cGovernment funding will help, but that will take time to unravel and to flush out any bottlenecks,\u201d Campanini continues. \u201cThey will want to make sure it\u2019s not just a knee-jerk reaction, and that they maintain onshore capability. It will require providing electronics at lower cost \u2013 which is why everything moved to Taiwan in the first place. Running semiconductor fabs in the U.S. will be more expensive than in Taiwan due to labor and other costs.\u201d\n\nMany suppliers are expanding their facilities and also their workforces to combat the delays, but no one has yet gotten ahead of the supply curve:\n\n\u201cWe see that our industry partners and subcontractors are investing to increase capacity and to hire additional staff, so we expect that the current supply constraints will ease in the near future,\u201d O\u2019Neill says. \u201cEven though longer lead times on rad-tolerant FPGAs are driven more by assembly and screening-cycle times than by semiconductor wafer availability, we still welcome government investment in domestic microelectronics production as it will provide us with more choices for future generations of products and help reduce reliance on foreign sources.\u201d\n\nSome question whether government investment in the short term will be enough.\n\n\u201cThe electronics market is fueled by lower costs and customers will always push for lower and lower costs, especially in the commercial markets which drives most of the demand for semiconductors.\u201d Campanini says. \u201cWill this lower-cost desire push production offshore again in the future? A more comprehensive approach beyond simply throwing some money at the short-term needs may be needed to avoid the future pendulum swing back to lower cost, offshore production.\n\nManaging costs and COTS in space\n\nWhile the supply chain remains a procurement challenge, designers are being forced to innovate to meet reduced size, weight, power, and cost (SWaP-C) demands with commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) while maintaining acceptable radiation-tolerance levels so the systems don\u2019t fail when hit with cosmic rays.\n\nThe demand is for rapid deployment of systems with lower costs that are built with system-level redundancy rather than component-level redundancy, Campanini notes. \u201cThis makes it tough to pack in rad-tolerance, but the lower mission assurance goes along with the constellation architecture. On a positive side, designing these simpler systems can be done more quickly than larger, more complex systems, so you have a faster time to deployment.\u201d\n\nThere is a \u201cconsistent trend to lower radiation levels, but guaranteed at those lower levels, in support of the vastly increasing LEO missions,\u201d he continues. \u201cWhile not to a low enough level to allow use of commercial or non-radiation hardened components without shielding or other system level mitigation features, there is an expectation of significant cost reductions. Semiconductor suppliers are stepping up to provide lower radiation performance products, often in plastic packages at significantly lower costs.\n\nLeveraging commercial manufacturing can also help traditional rad-hard electronics suppliers mitigate some of the challenges with readying COTS components for space applications\n\n\u201cTo manage the reduced cost requirements and demand for COTS components, we leverage commercial foundries,\u201d Apogee\u2019s Quiroz says. \u201cFor higher-volume applications like small sats, the price points are better than upscreening. When you upscreen a part, you\u2019re basically wrapping a $100 bill around it. With a ground-up commercial silicon process, you\u2019re bolting on the rad-hard components using plastic packaging. This allows you to take advantage of commercial test flows and tailor the product to an aggressive price target and high-volume applications \u2013 those that procure more than 100,000 units.\u201d (Figure 2.)\n\n[Figure 2 | Apogee Semiconductor\u2019s rad-hard logic family is available at 30 to 300 krads, with plastic and ceramic package flows, for small sat, military space, and commercial missions.]\n\nMicrochip has two complementary approaches to the demands for higher-volume, lower-cost space components, O\u2019Neill says: \u201cOne of our approaches revolves around the concept of \u2018Sub-QML\u2019 [qualified manufacturers list] devices. This concept takes products which have been designed to provide a high level of radiation tolerance and reduces or eliminates costly QML testing and screening. The result is a product line that has the radiation characteristics and the flight heritage of a traditional QML product line, but with optimized testing and reduced paperwork and a lower price point. The second approach is the \u2018COTS to RT\u2019 concept, which takes commercial or automotive products and provides additional screening and radiation testing to provide assurance on the suitability of the product for deployment in space.\u201d\n\nWith the military, however, it\u2019s never a one-size-fits-all approach. It always comes down to requirements and it\u2019s a fact that those requirements \u2013 component, system, or platform \u2013 are all determined by the mission.\n\n\u201cRad-hard product costs are driven by material costs as rad-hard components are often 500 to over 1,000 times more expensive than COTS components. The key to leveraging COTS components for space is to understand the true component requirements, why the engineers and procurement officers are buying this part,\u201d Campanini explains. \u201cThey help us tailor the certification flows to a COTS level. Figuring out what you need and don\u2019t need, understanding the true requirements, enables designs with next-level mitigation schemes to allow the use of components with no reduction in reliability.\u201d (Figure 3.)\n\n[Figure 3 | Pictured is the Micropac FMC card \u2013 high-rel board design.]\n\nOpen standards\n\nOpen standards and architectures are also a strategy for reducing costs and leveraging commercial technology for military systems.\n\n\u201cSpaceVPX and other standards have been seen across many military space customers,\u201d Campanini says. \u201cMicropac is advancing a Common Device Archi\u00adtec\u00adture (CDA) approach to standardization.\n\n\u201cThe significant growth in small-sat applications is directly fueled by open standards,\u201d he continues. \u201cThe very standardized CubeSat (available as catalog items) to the larger small sats using standard elements such as VPX cards and off-the-shelf building blocks (batteries, processor cards, etc.) within custom chassis is gaining in popularity. Short(er) lead times and ease of development is driving this approach.\u201d (For more on SpaceVPX see the article on page 12.)\n\nStandards are also being developed and discussed for packaging of components. \u201cWe are involved in the Space Power Consortium (spacepower.org), which looks to bring commercial standards to power systems for space exploration,\u201d Quiroz says. \u201cThere is also a standard being developed around plastic packaging for space components. This is happening inside JEDEC [standards body]. While there is a standard process around traditional ceramic flow, with military specifications that must be met, there is not one for a plastic flow. As demand for plastic packaged devices increases a standard will be necessary to ensure consistent performance. I think we are at least a year away from a formal announcement regarding the standard.\u201d\n\nAI innovation in space systems\n\nOpen architectures and commercial technology also drive innovation in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), now being used in military systems. Suppliers are seeing increased requirements for AI solutions in space systems.\n\n\u201cThere are a few companies coming up with AI-based solutions for imaging or other sensor applications in space systems,\u201d Quiroz says. \u201cDefense funding is driving some of this.\u201d\n\nMany initial applications for AI in space are geared toward imaging and other sensor applications.\n\n\u201cThere are many reasons why AI is interesting to developers of space systems. An example often quoted is cloud detection,\u201d O\u2019Neill says. \u201cIn an Earth-observation system which seeks to capture images of objects on the Earth\u2019s surface, images of the tops of clouds obscuring the ground or sea beneath are of no use. An AI system that can recognize images as cloud tops and discard them conserves storage capacity and downlink bandwidth. There are many other examples where AI can be used to conserve resources, or to make autonomous decisions on-orbit, removing ground-based humans from the decision loop, speeding response times for autonomous or robotic missions, speeding the acquisition of scientific data, or perhaps even enabling a rapid response during a national-security mission.\u201d\n\nMicrochip has introduced the VectorBlox AI/ML software development kit and IP for use in its FPGAs for image-processing applications, O\u2019Neill notes. It saves as much as 70% power when compared to equivalent SRAM [static random-access memory] FPGAs. The ability to perform intense AI applications while generating significantly less heat than competing solutions provides a significant advantage for space designers, he adds.",
    "As the holidays approached and supply chains remain strained, businesses and consumers were eager for a return to normalcy in time for end-of-year surges. But with shipping containers stalled at ports and labor shortages reducing available workers, supply chain managers are seeing little improvement as 2021 comes to a close.\n\nWhile \u201cChristmas Is Canceled\u201d headlines mighty sound hyperbolic, they highlight an unfortunate truth for businesses and consumers alike: Widespread delays and price increases are here to stay \u2014 at least for now \u2014 and will certainly have repercussions this holiday season. Experts believe many supply chain challenges will even get worse before they get better. Most pressing among these challenges are capacity constraints, driver shortages and the practice of double loading by carriers.\n\nOn a single day in mid-October, a record 200,000 shipping containers sat on stalled ships off the coast of Los Angeles. Even now, the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach are still trying to make room by announcing fines of $100 per container per day against shipping companies if containers stay in port for more than nine days. While the fines might help reduce some of the buildup, they\u2019re not a long-term solution, especially when trains, trucks and infrastructure are all similarly strained.\n\nIn fact, one of the biggest issues to blame for capacity constraints, both in the U.S. and abroad, is a lack of drivers. Unlike short-term issues like capacity and demand, the driver shortage might not have a clear solution in sight. The numbers in the U.S. are alarming: More than half of all truckers today are over the age of 45, and nearly a quarter are over 55 \u2014 meaning they\u2019ll hit retirement age in the next 10 years.\n\nWithout enough drivers to transport high-demand goods, carriers will sometimes cut corners and double up on freight without the permission of its shippers. They can bypass the seals on trailers and add cargo to an existing shipment, often without third-party logistics providers or shippers ever knowing. This practice represents a major breach of integrity and security, but is likely to continue as long as shippers lack visibility of their product.\n\nDespite the supply chain risks companies continue to face, new progress on infrastructure and technology adoption offer hope. Some developments can deliver relief right now, while others will take years. Overall, the past couple of years has yielded promising new solutions to the challenges at hand.\n\nAccording to the White House, some 20%, or 173,000 miles, of the nation's highways and major roads are in poor condition, as well as 45,000 bridges.\n\nPublic roadways are no better, with the American Society of Civil Engineers giving American infrastructure a C-minus grade in a 2021 report card. The report said 43% of America\u2019s public roadways were in poor or mediocre condition, a number that has remained stagnant over the past several years.\n\nFortunately, lawmakers in Washington have come to an agreement on a $550 billion infrastructure bill, which includes $66 billion in investment for passenger and freight rail and $110 billion to make improvements to America\u2019s roads and bridges. These infrastructure investments, while not necessarily quick fixes, have the opportunity to do wonders for the efficiency and speed at which shippers and 3PLs can move cargo.\n\nWith capacity issues and driver shortages remaining for the foreseeable future, visibility offers immediate solutions. With shippers, 3PLs and carriers pushed to their limits, increased visibility allows companies to maximize their assets and drivers by identifying the most efficient routes. Real-time analysis of driving behavior can also protect the drivers themselves by avoiding road hazards, red zones and other risks. Though not an exhaustive solution to capacity and driver shortages, route and product visibility allows managers to mitigate risk and reduce transportation costs.\n\nAt the same time, shippers and 3PLs can use visibility to hold carriers accountable. The 3PLs and shippers with visibility of the location and status of their products can better enforce standard operating procedures.\n\nWhile there are many substantial issues to resolve to relieve the pressure on supply chains, technology and infrastructure breakthroughs offer opportunities in the coming years to address some of the biggest risks we face today.\n\nBarry Conlon is chief executive officer and founder of Overhaul.",
    "\u2018A comprehensive tool that can take you from crawl to walk to run\u2019\n\nInfosec experts have welcomed the US National Institute of Standards and Technology\u2019s (NIST\u2019s) overhaul of its cybersecurity supply chain risk management guidance (C-SCRM).\n\nDeveloped in response to an executive order signed by President Biden in May 2021, the revised C-SCRM document provides advice on identifying, assessing, and addressing cybersecurity risks throughout the supply chain.\n\nThe publication \u2013 \u2018Cybersecurity Supply Chain Risk Management Practices for Systems and Organizations\u2019 (PDF) \u2013 urges acquirers and end users of hardware, software, and digital services to undertake due diligence on the origin and security of a digital product\u2019s components.\n\n\u201cIf your agency or organization hasn\u2019t started on [C-SCRM], this is a comprehensive tool that can take you from crawl to walk to run, and it can help you do so immediately,\u201d said NIST\u2019s Jon Boyens, co-author of the publication, in a press release.\n\n\u2018Foundational best practices\u2019\n\nAttackers are increasingly targeting digital supply chains because they can compromise multiple devices, applications or organizations by poisoning or exploiting weaknesses in widely used components, with the 2020 SolarWinds attack the most devastating example to date.\n\nIlkka Turunen, field CTO at software supply chain security specialist Sonatype, told The Daily Swig: \u201cAs next-gen supply chain attacks increase, the C-SCRM guidance formalizes many known practices across organizations large and small.\n\n\u201cIt describes foundational best practices \u2013 like generating SBOMs [software bill of materials] \u2013 and the sustaining activities needed to maintain effective supply chain security practices.\n\nHe continued: \u201cThis compendium of knowledge imparts how to defend against future log4Shell issues and other next-gen threats. It\u2019s time for organizations to invest into automating these processes.\u201d\n\nRELATED NIST revamps aging enterprise patch management guidance\n\nTim Mackey, principal security strategist at Synopsys Cybersecurity Research Center, said the document covers much more than the value of SBOM for open source components.\n\n\u201cSoftware enters an organisation from multiple origin points, including open source and API usage,\u201d he told The Daily Swig.\n\n\u201cOperators of software, whether the software is purely open source in nature or the result of proprietary development, effectively accept the business risks associated with the use of that software.\n\n\u201cMitigation of software risks start with an understanding of how managed and unmanaged software usage with an organisation occurs, and progressively mitigating those risks \u2013 not just at the vendor level, but continuously with each new software version and change.\u201d\n\nPersistent issues\n\nCequence Security, an API security specialist, recently sounded the alarm on the ongoing persistence of the critical Log4Shell vulnerability, which was discovered six months ago in the near-ubiquitous logging utility Apache Log4j.\n\nCatch up with the latest software supply chain attack news\n\nThe issue, which the firm dubbed \u2018LoNg4j\u2019, \u201cillustrates how interconnected modern enterprise IT infrastructure is and how this digital supply chain extends far beyond the known applications\u201d, said Jason Kent, Hacker in Residence at Cequence Security.\n\nThe revamped NIST guidance is currently available only as a PDF document, but the authors said they intend to also publish a more user-friendly, clickable web version and a quick-start guide aimed at organizations that are new to C-SCRM.\n\nRECOMMENDED Zero-day bug in uClibc library could leave IoT devices vulnerable to DNS poisoning attacks",
    "There are significant security risks resulting from the widespread use of open source software within modern application development, according to a new report.\n\nSnyk and The Linux Foundation have announced the results of their first joint research report, The State of Open Source Security, which reveals thyat many organisations are lacking strategies to address application vulnerabilities arising from code reuse.\n\nThe report also showed how many organisations are currently ill-prepared to effectively manage these risks. Specifically, the report found:\n\nOver four out of every ten (41%) organisations don't have high confidence in their open source software security\n\nThe average application development project has 49 vulnerabilities and 80 direct dependencies (open source code called by a project)\n\nThe time it takes to fix vulnerabilities in open source projects has steadily increased, more than doubling from 49 days in 2018 to 110 days in 2021.\n\n\"Software developers today have their own supply chains - instead of assembling car parts, they are assembling code by patching together existing open source components with their unique code. While this leads to increased productivity and innovation, it has also created significant security concerns,\" says Matt Jarvis, director, Developer Relations, Snyk.\n\n\"This first-of-its-kind report found widespread evidence suggesting industry naivete about the state of open source security today,\" he says.\n\n\"Together with The Linux Foundation, we plan to leverage these findings to further educate and equip the worlds developers, empowering them to continue building fast, while also staying secure.\"\n\n\"While open source software undoubtedly makes developers more efficient and accelerates innovation, the way modern applications are assembled also makes them more challenging to secure,\" adds Brian Behlendorf, general manager, Open Source Security Foundation (OpenSSF).\n\n\"This research clearly shows the risk is real, and the industry must work even more closely together in order to move away from poor open source or software supply chain security practices.\"\n\nAccording to the report, modern application development teams are leveraging code from all sorts of places. They reuse code from other applications they've built and search code repositories to find open source components that provide the functionality they need. The use of open source requires a new way of thinking about developer security that many organisations have not yet adopted.\n\nThe report found:\n\nLess than half (49%) of organisations have a security policy for OSS development or usage (and this number is a mere 27% for medium-to-large companies); and,\n\nThree in ten (30%) organisations without an open source security policy openly recognise that no one on their team is currently directly addressing open source security.\n\n\n\nWhen developers incorporate an open source component in their applications, they immediately become dependent on that component and are at risk if that component contains vulnerabilities. The report shows how real this risk is, with dozens of vulnerabilities discovered across many direct dependencies in each application evaluated.\n\nThis risk is also compounded by indirect, or transitive, dependencies, which are the dependencies of your dependencies. Many developers do not even know about these dependencies, making them even more challenging to track and secure.\n\nThat said, to some degree, survey respondents are aware of the security complexities created by open source in the software supply chain today:\n\nOver one-quarter of survey respondents noted they are concerned about the security impact of their direct dependencies;\n\nOnly 18% of respondents said they are confident of the controls they have in place for their transitive dependencies; and,\n\nForty percent of all vulnerabilities were found in transitive dependencies.\n\n\n\nAs application development has increased in complexity, the security challenges faced by development teams have also become increasingly complex. While this makes development more efficient, the use of open source software adds to the remediation burden. The report found that fixing vulnerabilities in open source projects takes almost 20% longer (18.75%) than in proprietary projects.",

    "Just as scientists and public health officials are daring to suggest the Covid pandemic might be entering its end-game, so China announces strict new lockdown measures, sparking fresh fears that disruptions to trade will be with us for some time yet.\n\nIs China really on the brink of an Omicron outbreak that could see the world\u2019s economic engine room splutter to a standstill? Or is China merely doing what China does - being authoritarian, and welding its citizens indoors in the run-up to the Beijing Winter Olympics? It\u2019s probably the latter, but only time will tell.\n\nEither way, it\u2019s a stark reminder that we live in uncertain times, and with 100,000 Russian troops gathering on Ukraine\u2019s border, things are not about to get any less uncertain.\n\nIn supply chain, uncertainty is the only certainty\n\nIt seems that today, uncertainty is the only certainty - and with supply chains being by their very nature global in scope, C-suiters are shock-proofing supply by reducing its exposure to risk.\n\nMultinational businesses are responding by shrinking supply chains. Smaller chains, smaller risks. Samsung US is re-shoring its chip manufacture, for example, with Apple set to follow suit, by making its own ARM-based microprocessors.\n\nAnd wherever you look, supply chains are being digitised, to increase visibility and agility, as companies seek to roll with the punches.\n\nWhere is the next punch coming from? China? Ukraine? A new flesh-eating virus from outer space? Or maybe a containership captain will attempt a three-point turn in the Suez Canal?\n\nWhatever ends up causing the next bout of chaos, there is no escaping the fact that ours is a shrinking world, with everything seemingly global. While this makes trade more responsive, it also means that a shock to one part is a shock to the whole. Just ask your nearest chief supply chain officer.\n\nLogistics - once on the periphery - is now a C-suite priority\n\nEdward Sweeney, Professor of Logistics and Supply Chain Management at the UK\u2019s Heriot-Watt University, says globalisation has followed a tumbling of barriers - to cross-border movement of products, services, capital, people and information.\n\nSweeney explores the impact of globalisation on logistics and supply chain management in his book, Global Logistics: New Directions in Supply Chain Management.\n\nIn it, he shows how logistics is now at the heart of long-term strategic plans in almost every business, when not so long ago it was on the periphery.\n\nIn an article for The Conversation - a source of news and research written by experts and academics - Sweeney says that uncertainty in a shrinking world \u201cis a characteristic of the international business landscape in which supply chains now operate\u201d.\n\nHe adds: \u201cAs a result, major companies have become strongly focused on supply chain risk management. This means identifying where risks of any kind exist in the network, assessing the potential impact of these risks, and putting mitigation strategies into place.\"\n\nHe says such strategies are wide-ranging, covering all manner of risk - both to demand and supply. There\u2019s also environmental risk, from socio-economic and socio-political factors, plus common-or-garden business risks, such as suppliers going bust.\n\nWith so much uncertainty and risk it\u2019s a wonder any CSCO or COO gets out of bed in the morning, for fear they\u2019ll be struck by a bus, or a meteorite.\n\nSo what might 2022 have in store for supply? Few are better placed than Sweeney to take a stab at that one.\n\nSustainability 'will be the next shock to supply chain'\n\nAs well as the unfolding situation in China, the likelihood of new Covid variants, and international shipping costs remaining high, Sweeney feels the biggest shake-up will come from the global bid for sustainability.\n\n\u201cFreight transportation and supply chain processes will change as more environmentally sustainable strategies are adopted,\u201d he says.\n\nThe biggest changes, he feels, will be a move to fleet e-vehicles and the relocating of distribution centres, to minimise distances travelled. He also expects to see more collaboration, as industry embraces sustainable practices. This can already be seen in the UK, in the work of the Centre for Sustainable Road Freight, he points out.\n\nThe sustainability drive, he writes, \u201cwill inevitably create short-term challenges as new practices become embedded\u201d.\n\nHe concludes: \u201cBusiness will have to be resilient and capable of adapting to major disruptions.\u201d\n\nWhich is another way of saying it's a mixed up, muddled up, shook-up world - and there\u2019s nothing supply chain teams can do but get on with it.\n\n",

Recent announcements by many auto manufacturers that production lines have been halted due to the impact of parts availability could be a warning for supply chains around the globe. A truly integrated, interconnected economy can create global risks.\n\nThe scope of the supply chain risk is enormous, but there are a number of basic concepts that might be helpful for organizations that are asking what can be done to mitigate potential risk in the here and now.\n\nPrioritize disruptions based on business impact on the customer Create a dedicated command and control structure Communicate via the command and control group to the following Suppliers Create metrics and expectations regarding the recovery process Fill rates Lead times Other relevant issues Share prioritized needs Daily reporting\n\nCustomers Set and manage expectations Provide immediate and transparent feedback regarding concerns and capabilities Seek feedback regarding customer priorities and needs Daily reporting\n\nInternal Stakeholders Set guidelines for authority and decision making (i.e., Incident Playbook) Daily reporting Listen and act upon operational feedback to manage resources Define when operational capability has returned to \u201cnormal\u201d\n\n\n\nCrisis represents an opportunity for success and a potential springboard to improve processes.

    "In this Supply Chain Live session, three supply and procurement professionals discuss risk and resilience.\n\nOn the panel were:\n\nSheldon Mydat, CEO at Suppeco, an AI-driven collaborative platform that enables companies to optimise customer-supplier ecosystems\n\nDavid Wylie, commercial and procurement director, Thames Water, the UK\u2019s biggest water and sewerage company.\n\nRuji Mahmud, head of procurement, Johnson Matthey, a chemicals company strong on sustainable technologies and with a payroll of 8,000.\n\nOpening the session by discussing the pandemic-driven supply chain crisis. Mydat said it\u2019s key that businesses invest heavily in relationships in order to mitigate risk. Asked how Johnson Matthey assesses procurement risk, Mahmud said the key was to have end-to-end visibility of the entire procurement process. Wylie, meanwhile says Thames Water segments its vulnerability to risk, and is also aware of any pinch-points its suppliers may face.\n\nThe panel also explored the issue of managing vendor relationships in large supply chains, with Wylie saying it was important to focus on the relationships \u201cthat make your businesses tick\u201d.\n\nCyberattack and risk in the supply chain\n\nThe trio also addressed supply chain resilience against cyberattack. Mydat says the non-standardisation of digital supply chains means cyber vulnerabilities do exist. Following that point, Wylie says businesses need to coach and educate suppliers on how to interface properly with digital supply chains, while Mydat said businesses also need to make sure they invest in educating their own people on interfacing with such systems.\n\nThe sessions ended with the panel offering predictions of what the future holds for risk and resilience in the supply chain. Among the answers were:",
    "Companies working to rectify supply chain issues that began during the COVID-19 pandemic face continuing challenges as problems have been amplified by recent events, including slowdowns at West Coast ports related to labor negotiations, the Shanghai pandemic shutdown, and the Russia-Ukraine war.\n\nLast week, Boeing Co. said production and deliveries of its 737 MAX aircraft were hit by shortages of a wiring connector; baby formula is in short supply across the United States due to pandemic-related supply chain issues and a recent recall; and the auto industry continues to be hampered by a semiconductor shortage.\n\nStrategies to mitigate supply chain disruptions can help but may change the risk profile of a company\u2019s operations, creating additional exposures, experts say.\n\nSome shipping companies are looking to address delays by expanding their capabilities so they can offer trucks, warehouses and rail cars in addition to ocean shipping, said John Frazee, a managing director in the U.S. marine practice at Marsh LLC, who is based in Los Angeles.\n\nThis approach may help them better control their supply chain by not relying on a third party, Mr. Frazee said. \u201cThe downside is that\u2019s a big expense, and only bigger companies can afford to do that,\u201d he said.\n\nShipping companies are also exploring alternative routes or ports. \u201cOn paper that sounds like problem solved, but if you don\u2019t own the vessel, you don\u2019t tell the vessel where to go,\u201d and finding ports that can discharge and transport cargo without delay remains challenging, Mr. Frazee said.\n\nUsing different routes to move products may also raise insurance concerns. \u201cAre they covered by the risk transfer programs that companies have?\u201d Mr. Frazee said. Accumulation risks and over-limit shipments are added concerns, he said.\n\nStrategies such as holding extra inventory or sourcing alternate suppliers create resilience in a company\u2019s operations and are good risk management, said David Shillingford, Salisbury, Connecticut-based chief strategy officer at Everstream Analytics, a supply chain risk analytics company.\n\nThey may have unintended consequences and increase risks, however. \u201cThe counterargument is that you increase your surface area and there are more things to go wrong,\u201d Mr. Shillingford said.\n\nCompanies should look to find the right balance, he said. \u201cIt\u2019s all about assembling the data and doing the analytics to work out where you need to be redundant and where it\u2019s not so important,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Russia-Ukraine war has exacerbated ongoing supply chain issues and risks, said Rahul Khanna, London-based global head of marine risk consulting at Allianz Global Corporate & Specialty SE, a unit of Allianz.\n\n\u201cRussia and Ukraine are both key suppliers of grain, so there are a lot of grain exports coming from these countries that are now disrupted,\u201d Mr. Khanna said. Vessels operating in the Black Sea, a major trading region, have been severely disrupted, he said.\n\nCrews may also be stuck on ships, creating logistics problems if they can\u2019t return home or others can\u2019t rejoin vessels, Mr. Khanna said. Over 10% of the world\u2019s 1.9 million seafarers come from Russia and 4% from Ukraine, AGCS said in a report released last week.\n\nInflation is compounding supply chain risks. \u201cThe cost of shipping one container from China to the U.S. a few years ago used to be $2,000 to $4,000 and is now $10,000 to $15,000 per container, which pushes up costs for everything,\u201d Mr. Khanna said.\n\nHigher freight rates and a shortage of container ship capacity are tempting some operators to use non-container vessels to transport containers, which raises questions around stability, firefighting capabilities and securing cargo, AGCS said in its Safety and Shipping Review 2022 report.\n\nLocal events, such as the Russia-Ukraine war and the latest port slowdown in Shanghai, are causing a global impact that is effectively \u201crewiring the way trade flows,\u201d said Suki Basi, managing director of London-based Russell Group, a data and analytics company.\n\nFor example, efforts are being made by some countries to secure alternative gas supplies from Africa and South America in response to the Russia-Ukraine conflict. \u201cNew relationships are evolving all the time,\u201d as countries look to trade with partners in \u201cmore secure parts of the world,\u201d Mr. Basi said.\n\nThe latest Shanghai COVID-19 lockdown has created severe delays at the port, delivering a $28 billion hit to global trade, with clothing and textile industries having the most exposure, according to an analysis by Russell Group.\n\nAny further supply chain shocks will continue to push up prices and slow down economic recovery in Western economies, but real-time data can help insurers, reinsurers, companies and policymakers understand and manage their risks, Russell Group said in its analysis.",
    "More than two years into the COVID-19 pandemic, and while organizations are working hard to resolve the supply chain problems impacting the United States and the rest of the world, global disruption persists and has impacted nearly every industry. Berardino Baratta, VP of projects and engineering at MxD, is dedicated to identifying how organizations can bolster supply chains to lessen the severity and duration of future shortages. He has created several supply chain projects that optimize secured data sharing and artificial intelligence (AI) to predict how supply chains can be affected by future situations.\n\nMxD MxD, located in Chicago, has a cutting-edge innovation center with a 22,000 square foot factory floor for demonstrating and experimenting with digital manufacturing and cybersecurity.\n\nRelated: IME West 2022 Keynote Speakers Address Supply Chain Challenges\n\nBerardino is confirmed to participate in a keynote panel with three of his peers this week at IME West. He will break down how organizations can use a unified system to fix and improve the supply chain to offset time and costs. Along with improved infrastructure, he expects the economy to thrive under these new implementations, even in the face of something unprecedented like a pandemic.\n\nIME West, which hosts MD&M West, WestPack, ATX West, D&M West, Plastec West, the Design. Engineer. Build. Conference, and the Cannabis Packaging Conference, slated to take place from April 12 to 14 at the Anaheim Convention Center, facilitates new product and technology discovery and advances the multi-billion-dollar manufacturing industry. Attendees can meet with peers and uncover the latest trends, technologies, and solutions under one roof while expanding their technical know-how through robust educational programming featuring dozens of expert-led panels.\n\nRelated: What's Next in the Evolution of Optoelectronic Devices and Innovations?\n\nWith the event kicking off this week, I had the pleasure of speaking with Berardino; we discussed how organizations can move forward amid today\u2019s supply chain challenges and how he envisions MxD staying ahead of the curb to handle any future disruptions of this magnitude.\n\nAdrienne Zepeda: Tell us a bit about yourself\n\nBerardino Baratta: I am the vice president of projects and engineering for MxD. In this role, I work closely with MxD\u2019s partners and internal teams to develop, test and commercialize advanced Industry 4.0 concepts and manufacturing technologies to increase innovation, capacity, and efficiency among U.S. manufacturers. In addition, I oversee MxD Cyber, which seeks to raise the cybersecurity profile of small and medium manufacturers to strengthen America\u2019s supply chain and MxD Learn, which aims to develop the manufacturing workforce of the future through a series of new skilling, re-skilling, and up-skilling cybersecurity and advanced manufacturing curriculum programs.\n\nI have over 25 years of diverse experience, including recent roles as senior director of technology strategy for MxD, CEO of Potentia Analytics \u2013 an AI healthcare startup \u2013 and general manager of Freescale Semiconductor\u2019s multimedia applications division. Prior to these roles, I led the strategy, marketing, and business development team for Freescale\u2019s wireless and mobile systems group. I began my career with Metrowerks Corporation, a leading provider of software development tools, where I led engineering through its growth from a startup to a public organization through acquisition by Motorola Corporation. I received my Bachelor of Mechanical Engineering (Honors) from McGill University.\n\nAdrienne Zepeda: How can we create a more resilient supply chain?\n\nBerardino Baratta: The COVID-19 pandemic has deepened the urgency and imperative for a secure, resilient, and robust supply chain. For MxD and our members, the COVID pandemic has only increased the sense of urgency around accelerating the use of these technologies so manufacturers can restart and thrive as the economy recovers. We know that expanding predictability into the manufacturing supply chain is more critical now than ever.\n\nTo date, MxD has funded 12 supply chain projects, including Supply Chain Risk Alert (SCRA) and Supply Chain Risk Alert 2 (SCRA2). MxD\u2019s active supply chain projects focus on increased supply chain visibility, secure data sharing, and artificial intelligence to predict future supply chain risks.\n\nSCRA developed a rapid analysis tool that provides policymakers and supply chain leaders an ability to efficiently assess a wide range of value chain designs for pandemic scenarios to optimize supply chain resiliency and agility during an emergency, so it is directly drawing from Industry 4.0 principles.\n\nFor SCRA2, MxD, along with industry partners, aims to develop a supply chain illumination and risk management middleware platform that provides policymakers and supply chain leaders the ability to understand who is in their supply chain and efficiently assess a wide range of potential and existing risks to their supply chain. The platform allows supply chain leaders to analyze the value chain designs of risk scenarios to optimize supply chain resiliency and agility during an emergency.\n\nThe tool developed through this project can modernize manufacturing for critical items such as medical device parts and help the Department of Defense and key manufacturing sectors map existing supply chains to identify vulnerabilities, foreign dependencies, and single-source suppliers. It also provides a pathway to identify alternate or indirect suppliers and model \u201cwhat if\u201d scenarios involving alternate supply chains to assess the benefit versus the risk of potential changes. This tool enables manufacturers to make data-informed decisions in times of crisis or urgency and minimize the impact on production capabilities.\n\nDERISC, which stands for Digital Education, Resilience, and Innovation for Supply Chain, is another important initiative that aims to provide U.S. manufacturers with a unified and systematic approach to renewing and securing their supply chains by providing the tools, protocols, skills, and information they need to undertake a secure digital transformation.\n\nDERISC brings three components (10K Manufacturers Awareness Campaign, MxD Cyber Marketplace, and MxD Learn Virtual Training Center) together in a comprehensive manner and lays out a clear path for how MxD, the national leader in digital manufacturing and cybersecurity for manufacturing, will leverage its assets to inform, empower and train U.S. manufacturers and their workforce to lead in the opportunities and challenges they face today and in the years to come.\n\nDERISC establishes the foundation of a unique offering by empowering thousands of manufacturers to update and secure their supply chains.\n\nAdrienne Zepeda: What can attendees look forward to learning during your upcoming keynote panel at IME West?\n\nBerardino Baratta: Attendees can look forward to learning about the different ways we can approach fixing and improving the supply chain. We will be discussing how to approach global risk management and resiliency with a focus on governmental policies and the impact on internal finances and manufacturing quality control. The other keynote panelists and I will also address how data and the automation of technologies, predictive maintenance, robotics, and virtualization can provide solutions to small and medium manufacturers.\n\nI will also touch on the nuances of reshoring and how it can benefit the supply chain. The COVID-19 pandemic amplified some problems that already existed. An increased interest in where our products come from indicates a greater awareness and appetite for reshoring manufacturing. Reshoring hinges on training and upskilling the workforce and coordinated investment and planning across the public and private sectors. We cannot sit here and watch foreign governments make considerable investments in their manufacturing sectors and expect to compete without the same magnitude of resources. The U.S. should also explore shortening the supply chain's length by conducting as much manufacturing as possible here.\n\nThe supply chain is too opaque; many manufacturers don\u2019t know where all their outsourced parts are coming from nor where to turn if that supply is interrupted.\n\nAdrienne Zepeda: What excites you about engaging with your community in person this week?\n\nBerardino Baratta: I am excited to be in person with my peers and be a part of this esteemed panel. As we know, the pandemic has impacted not only the supply chain but also the ability to gather in-person to hold these types of events.\n\nThis panel and conference are terrific opportunities to be among peers and like-minded individuals working toward similar goals. It is a space to share and exchange ideas for the greater cause.\n\nIME West keynote addresses are free to attend for all registered guests \u2013 secure a pass to the event here to tune into the Day 2 keynote panel titled \u201cCan Manufacturers Rebuild the Broken Global Supply Chain?\u201d Panelists include:",

    "Against a backdrop of highly publicized cyber hacks, ransomware attacks and extended goods shortages, supply chain risk management has taken center stage as a pressing operational and national security concern. This increased focus on strengthening and securing critical U.S. supply chains has already resulted in new requirements appearing in federal acquisitions, obligating federal contractors to identify, assess and mitigate supply chain-related security threats.\n\nAt this moment \u2013 as cyber and SCRM-related regulatory and contractual requirements are being implemented \u2013 there is an opportunity for motivated government contractors to stand out and differentiate themselves with strong SCRM practices. Doing so will better position these organizations to mentor and assist critical suppliers, minimize future cyber and supply chain disruptions, support national resilience and deliver value to agency customers. To put it simply, a short-term focus that fails to consider supply chain risk invites the possibility of new stresses to our national security posture and could expose companies to reputational harm and financial liability.\n\nHere are three considerations for federal contractors that are ready to seize on SCRM as a differentiator.\n\nSCRM is important to the customer\n\nIn the face of rising uncertainty over data security and surveillance by foreign adversaries, federal agencies are progressively relying on their industry partners to proactively monitor their third-party ecosystems. It is increasingly important for government that contractors have a solid understanding of the companies that they are working with and the risks that they may present.\n\nIn addition to other steps taken by the federal government related to supply chain security, recent executive orders direct agencies to assess the global and U.S. supply chains for specific segments of the industrial base, and to enhance the security of the software supply chain. Legislative acts have also been put into place that emphasize a preference for U.S.-made products and ban government purchases of certain foreign-sourced equipment and services.\n\nThe more that contractors align with federal supply chain security efforts, the better that they can protect their government customers (and themselves). Companies should monitor the evolution of top initiatives guiding agency and contractor behaviors and best practices. Several important initiatives to take note of include:\n\nNational Institute of Standards and Technology\u2019s Special Publication 800-161,Revision 1(slated to be finalized in April 2022) \u2013 designed to support federal agencies in identifying, assessing and mitigating supply chain risks associated with information and communications technology (ICT), the draft revision introduces a preliminary maturity model concept meant to improve visibility into and control of the highest impact ICT supply chain risks.\n\nCybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency Information and Communications Technology SCRM Task Force \u2013 the leading public-private partnership focused on enhancing ICT supply chain security strategies recently published practical resources meant to assist organizations with mitigating threats to the ICT supply chain.\n\nDoD\u2019s Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification \u2013 intended to boost cybersecurity within the defense industrial base, the model is under review to ensure it does not unfairly penalize smaller companies.\n\nFederal Acquisition Security Council \u2013 compelled by the SECURE Technology Act, this interagency body is tasked with developing uniform criteria for a SCRM program across federal agencies, including procedures for information sharing. On Aug. 26, 2021, the body issued a final rule to implement the requirements of the laws that govern the operation of the FASC.\n\nExecutive Order on Improving the Nation\u2019s Cybersecurity \u2013 this ambitious EO directs change in a number of areas. Germane to this topic, it requires \u2013 in defined circumstances \u2013 vendors to provide a software bill of materials, which is a record of components and supply chain relationships used in building software, effective May 2022.\n\nSCRM is showing up in procurements\n\nThe need for improved supplier visibility is impacting the federal procurement process with increasing regularity. Numerous GSA-led procurements have included cybersecurity and SCRM requirements, including ASTRO, GSA 8(a) STARS III, GSA Enterprise Infrastructure Solutions and GSA\u2019s Second-Generation IT BPA, among others.\n\nWhile CMMC is technically a DoD requirement, the GSA Polaris draft RFP indicates that bidders should expect to participate in CMMC in order to win DoD work through the vehicle. Awardees should also expect to submit a SCRM plan within 30 days of the end of each contract year.\n\nAlso highlighted in the Polaris draft RFP, GSA is creating its Vendor Risk Assessment Program to assess and monitor supply chain risks of critical vendors. The VRAP will rely on technology and other means to better understand, continuously monitor and identify risks in vendor supply chains. As part of the program, GSA plans to perform audits of vendor supply chain processes and events.\n\nWe are also seeing SCRM requirements in a variety of DoD and intelligence community procurements. Contractors should be aware that \u2013 especially for significant or critical IT procurements \u2013 the government is articulating a need to understand how vendors are managing their supply chains and mitigating associated risks. SCRM requirements and oversight into SCRM practices will become standard practice for these types of procurements.\n\nImportantly, these early SCRM requirements largely rely on self-attestation: government vendors represent that they comply with or follow best practices. As tools, technologies and processes mature, there is likely to be a movement toward more mature, active monitoring of contractor practices through programs like GSA\u2019s VRAP.\n\nSCRM is a good business practice\n\nFor companies who do business with the federal government, even those that may be several tiers down in the supply chain, supply chain risk management is no longer something that is nice to have or that just makes good business sense; it is becoming a necessity. For some organizations, strong SCRM practices can serve as a competitive advantage. We believe that contractors should not wait for these requirements to show up in a procurement or to be included as a contractual requirement; they should be proactive in addressing these risks.\n\nOrganizations with strong SCRM functions are typically anchored in three key capabilities (often bolstered by zero-trust principles): 1) the ability to withstand impacts and ensure business continuity based on a full understanding of the risk landscape, 2) the ability to use data to facilitate quick decision making based on key performance indicators, and 3) the ability to proactively monitor third parties to help anticipate threat vectors and act accordingly.\n\nOrganizations that are beginning the journey to build a SCRM function should consider taking the following actions:\n\nPut a SCRM plan in place. Identify internal and external supply chain risks. Establish policies and practices to manage risks across the supply chain life cycle \u2013 and to respond to threats and incidents as they occur. Build and engage a SCRM team for oversight and improvement.\n\nAssess third-party suppliers. To the extent possible, contractors should map their supply chain. Understand who your suppliers are, where they operate and what your organization needs from them. Identify alternate suppliers in cases where critical inputs are reliant on a single supplier (becoming a single point of failure stemming from an unforeseen disruption).\n\nMonitor, evaluate and iterate. Supply chain illumination software can support visibility into suppliers well beyond the first and second tiers, monitor dynamic risks, track supplier performance, incidents and responses, evaluate what is working and where to improve. A good plan will have periodic checks and updates, to ensure that it is being followed and that it is still effective.\n\nWe expect that SCRM requirements will continue to evolve and expand. Currently, supply chain security can serve as a differentiator in an area that is receiving a lot of attention. Early adopters who implement SCRM plans and mature themselves based on operational realities will be better positioned to minimize risks in a manner that is best suited to their business, and to demonstrate the value they can bring to their government customers, that others may have difficulty replicating. Government contractors should seize on SCRM now, for tomorrow.",
    "Exiger launched Supply Chain Explorer, a proprietary real-time supply chain risk detection Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) platform that empowers companies and government agencies to rapidly surface, understand and mitigate critical threats to their immediate and extended supplier networks.\n\n\u201cThe turbulence of the market has given us unique insight into the challenges our clients face in trying to understand their supplier networks in both their day-to-day work and in a crisis,\u201d says Brendan Galla, Exiger\u2019s chief product officer.\n\nFrom PR Newswire:\n\nSupply Chain Explorer was developed in close collaboration with some of the largest corporations and critical government agencies.\n\nSupply Chain Explorer allows users to visualize, prioritize and escalate high risk relationships.

    "Often the business systems you rely on most can be the most neglected. They have been running well for years without much attention. The assumption is that this situation will continue and the business can focus and invest in more \u2018sexy\u2019 solutions. However, long held assumptions must be challenged.\n\nFacing new workplace realities\n\nIt can be daunting to look back on the events of the last few years and the list of issues we have all faced with the often-unexpected impacts on our employees and ways of working.\n\nThe threats posed to business are changing. Are our long-held assumptions still valid? Are our organisations as secure and resilient as they need to be? Is it time to take stock and develop new strategies?\n\nThe pandemic drove employees to work from home and it seems as if a more hybrid working model is here to stay. This has pushed out the security boundaries of organisations and introduced new points of vulnerability. No longer are the vast majority of staff accessing business systems from the relatively secure environment of the office. Employees now need access to core systems via their home internet or mobile devices.\n\nThe Great Resignation\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic also prompted the phenomenon known as the \u2018Great Resignation\u2019. It has seen record numbers of people change jobs or simply leave the job market completely. However, The Institute of Employment Studies sees this more as the \u2018Great Retirement\u2019 with many over 50s falling out of the UK workforce. UK labour market statistics have shown that there are now 180,000 fewer over 50s in work than before the pandemic. Is your organisation in danger of losing long term staff who\u2019ve kept your key legacy systems running smoothly?\n\nWe believe that the pendulum will swing back towards the office. People whose first job was working from home will realise the importance of forming relationships, teamwork, collaboration and taking on leadership roles. Nevertheless, we need to continue to be aware of the impacts of hybrid working and adjust accordingly.\n\nSupply chain upheavals\n\nThe pandemic, the war in Ukraine and Brexit have shone the spotlight on supply chains and led to governments and businesses questioning the benefits of globalisation. Even after two years of COVID-19, supply chain surprises continue to emerge. CNN recently reported, \u201cChina's unwavering commitment to stamping out COVID by locking down big cities such as Shanghai threatens to deal a hefty shock to its vast economy, place more strain on global supply chains and further fuel inflation.\u201d\n\nShanghai is China\u2019s most populous city at 26 million, home to its leading financial centre, and some of its largest sea and airports. Lock down here will have a much greater impact on global supply chains than the closure of the likes of Wuhan, China\u2019s 9th largest city with a population of eight million. This is just one of many examples of why organisations are looking again at their key suppliers. It, in turn, will impact supply chain and production systems to which trusted partners are given access.\n\nThere is a significant increase of supply chain risk across all our industries. It suggests that as a nation we must maintain some capability in the UK so that we do not lose the competencies essential to our supply chain.\n\nIn IT this can mean we ensure all work is properly documented, and all teams contain a UK-based employee so that we can always re-train our technical staff. We also need to be able to rapidly skill-up new employees if our remote workers suddenly become unavailable.\n\nIncreased cyber threats\n\nHybrid working and the changes in supply chains will increase vulnerabilities. This is compounded by ever evolving threats from cyber attackers and an increased level of danger from state-sponsored bad actors.\n\nMany expected Russian cyber attacks against Ukraine. The Ukrainian government called on the \u2018hacker underground\u2019 to come to its defence which has offered some levels of protection. A more complete understanding of the impact of the cyber element of the Russian attack of Ukraine will not be possible until after the conflict ends. However, The Council on Foreign Relations has already identified numerous malware and denial of service attacks on Ukraine which have been kept off the front pages by more traditional warfare.\n\nIf the war continues and deepens it is likely that other nations, businesses and supply chains could see increased cyber attacks from Russia and other sources of state-sponsored cyber aggression.\n\nProtect your systems of record\n\nWith so much changing over the last few years, is your business now at greater risk from cyber attack? A large proportion of cyber security effort has been focused on newly installed systems and apps which are often customer facing. This is important but have you left an open door to vital legacy systems?",
